Relative  Clauses\n\nLook at these sentences\n\n- (a) All morning Lencho - who knew his fields intimately - looked at the  sky.\n- (b) The woman, who was preparing supper , replied, 'Yes, God willing.''\n\nThe italicised parts of the sentences give us more information about Lencho and the woman. We call them relative clauses . Notice that they begin with a relative pronoun who . Other common relative pronouns are whom , whose , and which .\n\nThe relative  clauses  in  (a)  and  (b)  above  are  called non-defining ,  because we  already  know  the  identity  of  the  person  they  describe.  Lencho  is  a particular person, and there is a particular woman he speaks to. We don't need the information in the relative clause to pick these people out from a larger  set.\n\nA  non-defining  relative  clause  usually  has  a  comma  in  front  of  it  and  a comma after it (some writers use a dash (-) instead, as in the story).

Using  Negatives  for  Emphasis\n\nWe know that sentences with words such as no,  not or nothing show  the absence of something, or contradict something. For example:\n\n- (a) This year we will have no corn. (Corn will be absent)\n- (b) The hail has left nothing. (Absence of a crop)\n- (c) These  aren't  raindrops  falling  from  the  sky,  they  are  new  coins. (Contradicts the common idea of what the drops of water falling from the sky are)\n\nBut sometims negative words are used just to emphasise an idea. Look at these  sentences  from  the  story:\n\n- (d) Lencho…had done nothing else but see  the  sky  towards  the  northeast. (He had done only this)\n- (e) The man went out for no other reason than to  have  the  pleasure of feeling the rain on his body. (He had only this reason)\n- (f) Lencho  showed not  the  slightest  surprise on  seeing  the  money. (He showed no surprise at all)\n\nNow look back at example (c). Notice that the contradiction in fact serves to emphasise the value or usefulness of the rain to the farmer.\n\nFind  sentences  in  the  story  with  negative  words,  which  express  the following  ideas  emphatically.\n\n1.

But in  a  country  like  South  Africa,  it  was  almost impossible for a man of my birth and colour to fulfil both of those obligations. In South Africa, a man of colour who attempted to live as a human being was punished and isolated. In South Africa, a man who tried  to  fulfil  his  duty  to  his  people  was  inevitably ripped from his family and his home and was forced to  live  a  life  apart,  a  twilight  existence  of  secrecy and rebellion.

Free  to run in the fields near my mother's hut, free to swim in the clear stream that ran through my village, free to  roast  mealies  under the stars and ride the broad backs of slow-moving bulls.

Later, as a  young  man  in  Johannesburg,  I  yearned  for  the basic  and  honourable  freedoms  of  achieving  my potential,  of  earning  my  keep,  of  marrying  and having a family - the freedom not to be obstructed in  a  lawful  life.\n\nBut then I slowly saw that not only was I not free,  but  my  brothers  and  sisters  were  not  free.  I saw  that  it  was  not  just  my  freedom  that  was curtailed, but the freedom of everyone who looked like I did.

He is very upset. A ball doesn't cost much, nor is it difficult to buy another ball. Why then is the boy so upset? Read the poem to see what the poet thinks has been lost, and what the boy has to learn from the experience of losing something.\n\nWhat is the boy now, who has lost his ball, What, what is he to do? I saw it go Merrily  bouncing, down the street, and then Merrily over - there it is in the water! No use to say 'O there are other balls': An ultimate shaking grief fixes the boy As he stands rigid, trembling, staring down All his young days into the harbour where His ball went. I would not intrude on him; A dime, another ball, is worthless. Now He senses first  responsibility In a world of possessions. People will take Balls,  balls  will  be  lost  always,  little  boy. And no one buys a ball back. Money is external. He is learning, well  behind  his  desperate  eyes, The epistemology of loss, how to stand up Knowing what every man must one day know And most know many days, how to stand up.\n\nJOHN BERRYMAN\n\nO there are other balls: The words suggest that the loss is not important enough to worry about shaking grief: sadness which greatly affects the boy rigid: stiff\n\n(to) intrude on:\n\nhere, to enter a situation where one is not welcome\n\na dime:\n\nten cents (U.S.)\n\ndesperate:\n\nhopeless\n\n- epistemology of loss: understanding the nature of loss - what it means to\n\nlose  something\n\n- epistemology: The Greek word episteme means 'knowledge' (it comes from a word meaning 'to understand, to know').

Her family had moved to Amsterdam after the Nazis gained power in Germany but were trapped when the Nazi occupation extended into the Netherlands. As persecutions against  the  Jewish  population increased, the family went into hiding in July 1942 in hidden rooms in her father Otto Frank's office building. After two years in hiding, the group was betrayed and transported to the concentration camp system where Anne died of typhus in Bergen-Belsen within days of her sister, Margot Frank. Her father , Otto, the only survivor of the group, returned to Amsterdam after the war ended, to find that her diary had been saved. Convinced that it was a unique record, he took action to have it published in English under the name The Diary of a Young Girl .\n\nThe diary was given to Anne Frank for her thirteenth birthday and chronicles the events of her life from 12 June 1942 until its final entry of 1 August 1944. It was eventually translated from its original Dutch into many languages and became one of the world's most widely read books. There have also been several films, television and theatrical productions, and even an opera, based on the diary. Described as the work of a mature and insightful mind, the diary provides an intimate examination of daily life under Nazi occupation. Anne Frank has become one of the most renowned and discussed of the Holocaust victims.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T08:57:35.049770Z"}

Not only because I've never written anything before,  but  also  because  it  seems  to  me that  later  on  neither  I  nor  anyone  else  will  be interested  in  the  musings  of  a  thirteen-year-old schoolgirl.  Oh  well,  it  doesn't  matter.  I  feel  like writing,  and I  have  an  even  greater  need  to  get  all kinds of things off my chest.\n\n'Paper has more patience than people.' I thought of this saying on one of those days when I was feeling a little depressed and was sitting at home with my chin  in  my  hands,  bored  and  listless,  wondering whether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed where I was, brooding: Yes, paper does have more patience, and since I'm not planning to let anyone else read this  stiff-backed  notebook  grandly  referred  to  as  a 'diary',  unless  I  should  ever  find  a  real  friend,  it probably won't make a bit of difference.\n\nNow I'm back to the point that prompted me to  keep  a  diary  in  the  first  place:  I  don't  have  a friend.\n\nLet  me  put  it  more  clearly,  since  no  one  will believe  that  a  thirteen-year-old  girl  is  completely alone in the world. And I'm not. I have loving parents and a sixteen-year-old sister,  and  there  are  about thirty  people  I  can  call  friends.  I  have  a  family, loving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I seem to have everything, except my one true friend. All I think about when I'm with friends is having a good time. I can't bring myself to talk about anything but ordinary everyday things. We don't seem to be able to get any closer, and that's the problem. Maybe it's my fault that we don't confide in each other. In any  case,  that's  just  how  things  are,  and unfortunately they're  not  liable  to  change.  This  is why I've started the diary.\n\nTo enhance the image of this long-awaited friend in  my  imagination,  I  don't  want  to  jot  down  the facts  in  this  diary  the  way  most  people  would  do, but I want the diary to be my friend, and I'm going to  call  this  friend  'Kitty'.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T08:57:35.049770Z"}

My  sister,  Margot,  was  born in Frankfurt in Germany in 1926. I was born on 12 June 1929. I lived in Frankfurt until I was four. My father  emigrated  to  Holland  in  1933.  My  mother, Edith  Hollander  Frank,  went  with  him  to  Holland in  September,  while  Margot  and  I  were  sent  to Aachen to stay with our grandmother. Margot went to Holland in December, and I followed in February, when I was plunked down on the table as a birthday present for  Margot.\n\nI  started  right  away  at  the  Montessori  nursery school. I stayed there until I was six, at which time I  started  in  the  first  form.  In  the  sixth  form  my teacher was Mrs Kuperus, the headmistress. At the end of the year we were both in tears as we said a heartbreaking  farewell.\n\nIn the summer of 1941 Grandma fell ill and had to  have  an  operation,  so  my  birthday  passed  with little  celebration.\n\nGrandma died in January 1942. No one knows how often  I  think  of  her  and  still  love  her.  This birthday celebration in 1942 was intended to make up for the other, and Grandma's candle was lit along with  the  rest.\n\nThe four of us are still doing well, and that brings me to the present date of 20 June 1942, and the solemn dedication of my diary.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T08:57:35.049770Z"}

Do you know how to use a dictionary to find out the meanings of idiomatic expressions? Take, for example, the expression caught my eye in  the  story . Where - under which word - would you look for it in the dictionary? Look for it under the first word. But if the first word is a 'grammatical' word like a , the , for ,  etc.,  then  take  the  next  word.  That  is,  look  for  the  first 'meaningful' word in the expression. In our example, it is the word caught .\n\nBut you won't find caught in  the  dictionary, because it is the past tense of catch . You'll find caught listed under catch . So you must look under catch for the expression caught my eye .

Be  brief.\n\n'Diary  language'  has  some  typical  features  such  as  subjectless  sentences  (Got up late  in  the  morning),  sentence  fragments  without  subjects  or  verbs  (…too bad, boring, not good), contracted forms (they're, I've,  can't,  didn't,  etc.),    and everyday expressions which people use  in speech.

Maybe the father is not alive but the son still carries on the family profession. These bakers are, even today, known as pader in Goa.\n\nDuring our childhood in Goa, the baker used to be  our  friend,  companion  and  guide.  He  used  to come at least twice a day. Once, when he set out in the morning on his selling round, and then again, when he returned after emptying his huge basket. The jingling  thud  of  his  bamboo  woke  us  up  from sleep and we ran to meet and greet him. Why was it so? Was it for the love of the loaf? Not at all. The loaves  were  bought  by  some  Paskine  or  Bastine, the maid-servant of the house! What we longed for were those bread-bangles which we chose carefully. Sometimes it was sweet bread of special make.\n\nThe baker made his musical entry on the scene with the 'jhang, jhang' sound of his specially made bamboo staff. One hand supported the basket on his head and the other banged the bamboo on the ground. He would greet the lady of the house with 'Good morning' and then place his basket on the vertical  bamboo.  We  kids  would  be  pushed  aside with a mild rebuke and the loaves would be delivered to the servant. But we would not give up. We would climb  a  bench  or  the  parapet  and  peep  into  the basket,  somehow.  I  can  still  recall  the  typical fragrance of those loaves. Loaves for the elders and the bangles for the children. Then we did not even care  to  brush  our  teeth  or  wash  our  mouths properly. And why should we? Who would take the trouble  of  plucking  the  mango-leaf  for  the toothbrush? And why was it necessary at all? The tiger  never  brushed  his  teeth.

Not  enough  can  be said  to  show  how  important  a  baker  can  be  for  a village.  The  lady  of  the  house  must  prepare sandwiches  on  the  occasion  of  her  daughter's engagement. Cakes and bolinhas are  a  must  for Christmas  as  well  as  other  festivals.  Thus,  the presence  of  the  baker's  furnace  in  the  village  is absolutely  essential.\n\nThe baker or bread-seller  of  those  days  had  a peculiar dress known as the kabai . It was a singlepiece long frock reaching down to the knees. In our childhood  we  saw  bakers  wearing  a  shirt  and trousers  which  were  shorter  than  full-length  ones and  longer  than  half  pants.  Even  today,  anyone who wears a half  pant  which  reaches  just  below the  knees  invites  the  comment  that  he  is  dressed like  a pader !\n\nThe baker usually collected his bills at the end of the month. Monthly accounts used to be recorded on  some  wall  in  pencil.  Baking  was  indeed  a profitable profession in the old days. The baker and his  family  never  starved.  He,  his  family  and  his servants always looked happy and prosperous. Their plump physique was an open testimony to this. Even today  any  person  with  a  jackfruit-like  physical appearance is easily compared to a baker.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T08:57:51.207597Z"}

'Give us two cups,' Pranjol said.\n\nThey  sipped  the  steaming  hot  liquid.  Almost everyone in their compartment was drinking tea too.\n\n'Do you know that over eighty crore  cups of tea are drunk every day throughout the world?' Rajvir said.\n\n'Whew!' exclaimed Pranjol.  'Tea  really  is  very popular.'\n\nThe train pulled out of the station. Pranjol buried his nose in his detective book again. Rajvir too was an ardent fan of detective stories, but at the moment he was keener on looking at the beautiful scenery.\n\nIt  was  green,  green  everywhere. Rajvir had never seen so much greenery before. Then the soft green paddy fields gave way to tea bushes.\n\nIt  was  a  magnificent  view.  Against  the  backdrop of densely wooded hills a sea of tea bushes stretched as  far  as  the  eye  could  see.

(ii) On the other hand, Adrienne Rich has been known to use trees as a metaphor for human beings; this is a recurrent image in her poetry.

Do you have a pet? If you do, you perhaps know that a pet is a serious responsibility. Read in the box below what the SPCA the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals - has to say about how to care for a pet.\n\nOwning a pet is a lifetime of commitment (up to ten years or more if  you  own  a  dog  or  a  cat)  involving  considerable responsibility. The decision to acquire one, therefore, should be made by the whole family. Without full agreement by everyone,  the  pet  could  end  up  unwanted.  Puppies  and kittens are so adorable, it is easy to understand why adults and children alike would be attracted to them. Unfortunately their cute looks are often a disadvantage, because people purchase them without consideration and the knowledge on how to take proper care of them. The basic points you should keep in mind before adopting a puppy are:\n\n- an annual dog licence in accordance with government regulations\n- its annual vaccination against major diseases\n- toilet training\n- regular grooming and bathing\n- obedience training\n- don't forget you should feed your pet a balanced diet\n- socialisation (many dogs are kept confined in cages or tied up to stop them from dirtying the garden or from chewing on shoes - this is wrong) is very important\n- a daily dose of exercise, affection and play.\n\n![Image](outputs/jeff106/jeff106_artifacts/image_000001_fdf507cc4c7f8d97bf32d89dc4876ee05d5d1601330d62fd9fd11569357b2e54.png)","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T08:58:05.690831Z"}

The British airline to London would not  fly  animals,  so  I  booked  a  flight  to  Paris  on another  airline,  and  from  there  to  London.  The airline  insisted  that  Mij  should  be  packed  into  a box  not  more  than  eighteen  inches  square,  to  be carried  on  the  floor  at  my  feet.  I  had  a  box  made, and an hour before we started, I put Mij into the box so that he would become accustomed to it, and left  for  a  hurried  meal.\n\nWhen  I  returned,  there  was  an  appalling spectacle. There was complete silence from the box, but  from  its  airholes  and  chinks  around  the  lid, blood had trickled and dried. I whipped off the lock and tore open the lid, and Mij, exhausted and bloodspattered, whimpered and caught at my leg. He had torn the lining of the box to shreds; when I removed the  last  of  it  so  that  there  were  no  cutting  edges left,  it  was  just  ten  minutes  until  the  time  of  the flight,  and  the  airport  was  five  miles  distant.  I  put the miserable Mij back into the box, holding down the lid with my hand.\n\nI sat in the back of the car with the box beside me as the driver tore through the streets of Basra like  a  ricochetting bullet. The aircraft was waiting to take off; I was rushed through to it by infuriated officials.  Luckily,  the  seat  booked  for  me  was  at the  extreme  front.  I  covered  the  floor  around  my feet  with  newspapers,  rang  for  the  air  hostess, and gave her a parcel of fish (for Mij) to keep in a cool place. I took her into my confidence about the events  of  the  last  half  hour.  I  have  retained  the most profound admiration for that air hostess; she was  the  very  queen  of  her  kind.  She  suggested that I might prefer to have my pet on my knee, and I  could  have  kissed  her  hand  in  the  depth  of  my gratitude.  But,  not  knowing  otters,  I  was  quite unprepared for what followed.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T08:58:05.690831Z"}

He would play for hours with a selection  of  toys, ping-pong  balls,  marbles,  rubber  fruit,  and  a terrapin shell that I had brought back from his native marshes.  With  the  ping-pong  ball  he  invented  a game of his own which could keep him engrossed for  up  to  half  an  hour  at  a  time.  A  suitcase  that  I had  taken  to  Iraq  had  become  damaged  on  the journey  home,  so  that  the  lid,  when  closed, remained at a slope from one end to the other. Mij discovered  that  if  he  placed  the  ball  on  the  high end it  would  run  down  the  length  of  the  suitcase. He would dash around to the other end to ambush its  arrival,  hide  from  it,  crouching,  to  spring  up and take it by surprise, grab it and trot off with it to the high end once more.\n\nOutside  the  house  I  exercised  him  on  a  lead, precisely as if he had been a dog. Mij quickly developed certain  compulsive  habits on  these  walks  in  the London streets, like the rituals of  children  who  on their  way  to  and  from  school  must  place  their  feet squarely on the centre of each paving block; must touch every seventh upright of the iron railings, or pass to the outside of every second lamp post. Opposite to my flat was a single-storied primary school, along whose frontage ran a low wall some two feet high. On his way home, but never on his way out, Mij would tug me to this wall, jump on to it, and gallop the full length of its thirty yards, to the hopeless distraction both of pupils and of staff within.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T08:58:05.690831Z"}

It passed through her street each hour, once going to the town and once coming back. The sight of  the  bus,  filled  each  time  with  a  new  set  of passengers, was a source of unending joy for Valli.\n\nDay  after  day  she  watched  the  bus,  and gradually  a  tiny  wish  crept  into  her  head  and grew there: she wanted to ride on that bus, even if  just  once.  This  wish  became  stronger  and stronger,  until  it  was  an  overwhelming  desire. Valli  would  stare  wistfully at  the  people  who  got on  or  off  the  bus  when  it  stopped  at  the  street corner.  Their  faces  would  kindle in  her  longings, dreams, and hopes. If one of her friends happened to ride the bus and tried to describe the sights of the town to her, Valli would be too jealous to listen and  would  shout,  in  English:  'Proud!  proud!' Neither she nor her friends really understood the meaning of the word, but they used it often as a slang  expression  of  disapproval.\n\nOver  many  days  and  months  Valli  listened carefully  to  conversations  between  her  neighbours and people who regularly used the bus, and she also asked a few discreet questions here and there. This way she picked up various small details about the bus journey. The town was six miles from her village. The fare was thirty paise one way - 'which is almost nothing at all,' she heard one well-dressed man say, but  to  Valli,  who  scarcely  saw  that  much  money from one month to the next, it seemed a fortune. The trip to the town took forty-five minutes. On reaching town,  if  she  stayed  in  her  seat  and  paid  another thirty  paise,  she  could  return  home  on  the  same bus. This meant that she could take the one-o'clock afternoon bus, reach the town at one forty-five, and be back home by about two forty-five...\n\nOn and on went her thoughts as she calculated and recalculated,  planned  and  replanned.\n\nwistfully longingly set alight (a fire), here, feelings","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T08:58:21.941342Z"}

Stop the bus!' And a tiny hand was raised commandingly.\n\nThe  bus  slowed  down  to  a  crawl,  and  the conductor,  sticking  his  head  out  the  door,  said, 'Hurry then! Tell whoever it is to come quickly.'\n\n'It's me,' shouted Valli. 'I'm the one who has to get on.'\n\nBy  now  the  bus  had  come  to  a  stop,  and  the conductor said, 'Oh, really! You don't say so!'\n\n'Yes,  I  simply  have  to  go  to  town,'  said  Valli, still  standing  outside  the  bus,  'and  here's  my money.' She showed him some coins.\n\n'Okay, okay, but first you must get on the bus,' said the conductor, and he stretched out a hand to help her up.\n\n'Never mind,' she said, 'I can get on by myself. You don't have to help me.'\n\nThe conductor was a jolly sort, fond of joking. 'Oh, please don't be angry with me, my fine madam,' he said.  'Here,  have  a  seat  right  up  there  in  front. Everybody move aside please - make way for madam.'\n\nIt  was  the  slack  time of  day,  and  there  were only six or seven passengers on the bus. They were all looking at Valli and laughing with the conductor. Valli  was  overcome  with  shyness.  Avoiding everyone's  eyes,  she  walked  quickly  to  an  empty seat and sat down.\n\nslack  time a time when there is not much work\n\n![Image](outputs/jeff107/jeff107_artifacts/image_000005_56777c4b5b2eb7de9fadea472963f9fd354c640df99e58a72d9317d351df6341.png)","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T08:58:21.941342Z"}

Enlightened  after  seven days, he renamed the tree the Bodhi Tree (Tree of Wisdom) and began to teach and to share his new understandings. At that point he became known as the Buddha (the Awakened or the Enlightened). The Buddha preached his first  sermon at  the  city  of Benares, most holy of the dipping places on the River Ganges; that sermon has been preserved and is given here.  It  reflects  the  Buddha's  wisdom  about  one inscrutable kind of suffering.\n\nKisa Gotami had an only son, and he died. In her grief she carried the dead child to all her neighbours, asking them for medicine, and the people said, 'She has lost her senses. The boy is dead.'\n\nAt length, Kisa Gotami met a man who replied to her request, 'I cannot give thee medicine for thy child, but I know a physician who can.'\n\nAnd the girl said, 'Pray tell me, sir; who is it?' And the man replied, \"Go to Sakyamuni, the Buddha.'\n\nKisa Gotami repaired to the Buddha and cried, 'Lord and Master, give me the medicine that will cure my boy.'\n\nThe Buddha answered, 'I want a handful of mustardseed.' And  when the girl in her joy  promised to procure it, the Buddha added, 'The mustard-seed must be taken from a  house where no one has lost a child, husband, parent or friend.'\n\nPoor Kisa Gotami now went from house to house, and the people pitied her and said, 'Here is mustardseed;  take  it!'  But  when  she  asked,  'Did  a  son  or daughter, a father or mother, die in your family?' they answered her, 'Alas! the living are few, but the dead are many. Do not remind us of our deepest grief.' And there was no house but some beloved one had died in it.\n\nKisa Gotami became weary and hopeless, and sat down at the wayside watching the lights of the city, as they flickered up and were extinguished again. At last the darkness of the night reigned everywhere. And she considered the fate of men, that their lives flicker up and are extinguished again. And she thought to herself, 'How selfish am I in my grief! Death is common to all; yet in this valley of desolation there is a path that leads him to immortality who has surrendered all selfishness.'\n\nThe Buddha said, ''The life of mortals in this world is troubled and brief and combined with pain.

Break up the sentence into three simple sentences. Can you then say which has a better rhythm when you read it, the single sentence using  semicolons,  or  the  three  simple  sentences?\n\nFor there is not any means by which those who have been born can avoid dying; after reaching old age there is death; of such a nature are living beings.\n\nThe Buddha's sermon is over 2500 years old.

Good Grief\n\nA MITAI E TZIONI\n\nSoon after my wife died - her car slid off an icy road in 1985 - a school psychologist  warned me that my children and I were not mourning in the right way. We felt angry; the proper first stage, he said, is denial.\n\nIn late August this year, my 38-year-old son, Michael, died suddenly in his sleep, leaving behind a 2-year-old son and a wife expecting their next child.\n\nThere  is  no  set  form  for  grief,  and  no  'right'  way  to  express  it.  There seems  to  be  an  expectation  that,  after  a  great  loss,  we  will  progress systematically  through  the  well-known  stages  of  grief.

Read this article about a Russian wedding.\n\nPreparations for a  Russian Wedding: A Russian wedding is very simple. The planning only includes arranging for rings, brides' dress, cars, and a reception. Earlier, the bride's family paid for the reception, but now-a-days brides' and grooms' families usually share expenses. A Russian wedding lasts for two days; some weddings last as long as a week, and the occasion becomes something to remember for years. The necessary part of the wedding ceremony is a wedding procession of several cars. The best friends of the groom/ bride meet before the wedding a few times, make posters, write  speeches  and  organise  contests.  When  the  groom arrives to fetch the bride for the registration, he has to fight to  get  her!  Russians  usually  live  in  apartments  in  tall buildings, and the groom has to climb several stairs to reach his bride. But at each landing he must answer a question to  be  allowed  to  go  up.  The  bride's  friends  ask  difficult questions  (sometimes  about  the  bride,  sometimes  just difficult riddles), and the groom must answer with the help of his friends. For example, he may be shown a few photos of baby girls and he must say which one his bride is. If he guesses wrong, he must pay cash to move ahead.

After two or three hours of the city tour the couple arrives at the reception. The couple sits at a specially arranged table with their family, friends and invited guests. The reception starts with toasts to the couple. A wedding toast is a custom where a close friend or relative of the groom or the bride says a few words to wish the couple, then everyone raises their glass of wine, and drink it up at the same moment. The groom is then asked to kiss the bride. After a few toasts, people start eating and drinking, and generally have fun. After some time, the bride gets 'stolen'! She disappears, and when the groom starts looking for her, he is asked to pay a fee. Usually it is his friends  who  'steal'  the  bride.  Then  there  are  the  bride's friends - they steal the bride's shoe. The groom must pay money for the shoe too. The guests enjoy watching these tussles, and continue partying.\n\n2.

It was written in 1888-89.\n\nThe play is about the tendency of wealthy families to seek ties with other wealthy families, to increase their estates by encouraging marriages that make good economic sense. Ivan Lomov, a long time wealthy neighbour of Stepan Chubukov, also wealthy, comes to seek the hand of Chubukov's twenty-five-year-old daughter, Natalya. All three are quarrelsome people, and they quarrel over petty issues. The proposal is in danger of being forgotten amidst all this quarrelling.

Is she wise in this?\n- Who does 'I' refer to in this story?\n\nI  WAS  really  worried  about  Tricki  this  time.  I  had  pulled  up  my  car when I saw him in the street with his mistress and I was shocked at his appearance. He had become hugely fat, like a bloated sausage with a leg at each corner. His eyes, bloodshot and rheumy, stared straight ahead and his tongue lolled from his jaws.\n\nMrs Pumphrey hastened to explain, 'He was so listless, Mr Herriot. He seemed to have no energy. I thought he must be suffering from malnutrition,  so  I  have  been  giving  him  some  little  extras  between meals  to  build  him  up,  some  malt  and  cod-liver  oil  and  a  bowl  of Horlicks at night to make him sleep - nothing much really.'\n\n'And did you cut down on the sweet things as I told you?'\n\n'Oh, I did for a bit, but he seemed to be so weak I had to relent. He does love cream cakes and chocolates so. I can't bear to refuse him.'\n\nI looked down again at the little dog. That was the trouble. Tricki's only  fault  was  greed.  He  had  never  been  known  to  refuse  food;  he would tackle a meal at any hour of the day or night. And I wondered about all the things Mrs Pumphrey hadn't mentioned.\n\n'Are you giving him plenty of exercise?'\n\n'Well, he has his little walks with me as you can see, but Hodgkin, the  gardener,  has  been  down  with  lumbago,  so  there  has  been  no ring-throwing  lately.'","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T08:59:19.115829Z"}

Tricki looked down at the noisy pack with dull eyes and, when put down, lay motionless on the carpet. The other dogs, after sniffing round him for a few seconds, decided he was an uninteresting object and ignored him.\n\nI made up a bed for him in a warm loose box next to the one where the other dogs slept. For two days I kept an eye on him, giving him no food  but  plenty  of  water.  At  the  end  of  the  second  day  he  started  to show some interest in his surroundings and on the third he began to whimper when he heard the dogs in the yard.\n\nWhen I opened the door, Tricki trotted  out  and  was  immediately engulfed by Joe, the greyhound, and his friends. After rolling him over and thoroughly inspecting him, the dogs moved off down the garden. Tricki  followed  them,  rolling  slightly  with  his  surplus  fat.\n\nLater that day, I was present at feeding time. I watched while Tristan slopped the food into the bowls. There was the usual headlong rush followed by the sounds of high-speed eating; every dog knew that if he fell  behind  the  others  he  was  liable  to  have  some  competition  for  the last part of his meal.\n\nA Triumph of Surgery\n\n![Image](outputs/jefp101/jefp101_artifacts/image_000004_dfe08e5b2ddc05aea4094b326e6fdd8fed5f29e80346b7d3a9f4ffe17f88c74f.png)","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T08:59:19.115829Z"}

He would borrow one week, lend the  next.  He  kept  worrying  about  his  next  cheque,  but  as  soon  as  it arrived he would go out and celebrate. It seems he wrote for magazines a queer way to make a living!\n\nOne evening he came home with a small bundle of notes, saying he had just sold a book to a publisher. At night, I saw him tuck the money under the mattress.\n\nI  had  been  working  for  Anil  for  almost  a  month  and,  apart  from cheating on the shopping, had not done anything in my line of work. I had every opportunity for doing so. Anil had given me a key to the door, and I could come and go as I pleased. He was the most trusting person I had ever met.\n\nAnd that is  why  it  was  so  difficult  to  rob  him.  It's  easy  to  rob  a greedy man, because he can afford to be robbed; but it's difficult to rob a careless man - sometimes he doesn't even notice he's been robbed and that takes all the pleasure out of the work.\n\nWell, it's time I did some real work, I told myself; I'm out of practice.

Slipping out of the  blanket,  I  crept  up  to  the  bed.  Anil  was  sleeping  peacefully.  His face was clear and unlined; even I had more marks on my face, though mine were mostly scars.\n\nMy hand slid under the mattress, searching for the notes. When I found them, I drew them out without a sound. Anil sighed in his sleep and turned on his side, towards me. I was startled and quickly crawled out of the room.\n\nWhen I was on the road, I began to run. I had the notes at my waist, held there by the string of my pyjamas. I slowed down to a walk and counted the notes: 600 rupees in fifties!

The clock showed midnight. I felt for the notes. They were damp from the rain.\n\nAnil's money. In the morning he would probably have given me two or three rupees to go to the cinema, but now I had it all. I couldn't cook his meals, run to the bazaar or learn to write whole sentences any more.\n\nI  had  forgotten  about  them  in  the  excitement  of  the  theft.  Whole sentences, I knew, could one day bring me more than a few hundred rupees. It was a simple matter to steal - and sometimes just as simple to be caught. But to be a really big man, a clever and respected man, was something else. I  should go back to Anil, I told myself, if only to learn to read and write.\n\nI  hurried  back  to  the  room  feeling  very  nervous,  for  it  is  much easier  to  steal  something  than  to  return  it  undetected.  I  opened  the door  quietly,  then  stood  in  the  doorway,  in  clouded  moonlight.  Anil was still asleep. I crept to the head of the bed, and my hand came up with  the  notes.  I  felt  his  breath  on  my  hand.  I  remained  still  for  a minute. Then my hand found the edge of the mattress, and slipped under it with the notes.\n\nI  awoke  late  next  morning  to  find  that  Anil  had  already  made  the tea.  He  stretched  out  his  hand  towards  me.  There  was  a  fifty-rupee note between his fingers. My heart sank. I thought I had been discovered.\n\n'I  made some money yesterday,' he explained. 'Now you'll be paid regularly.'\n\nMy spirits rose. But when I took the note, I saw it was still wet from the  night's  rain.\n\n'Today we'll  start  writing  sentences,'  he  said.\n\nHe knew. But neither his lips nor his eyes showed anything. I smiled at Anil in my most appealing way. And the smile came by itself, without any effort.\n\nRUSKIN BOND\n\n![Image](outputs/jefp102/jefp102_artifacts/image_000009_57db056526b79a08209d97d976ebbfc1f6c768da3b0df6f7f6f6c7b905850888.png)","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T08:59:29.937014Z"}

He was about fifty  years  old  and  unmarried,  and  he  lived  with  a  housekeeper who worried over his health. In fact, he was usually very well and happy except  for  attacks  of  hay  fever  in  summer.  He  made  locks  and  was successful  enough  at  his  business  to  have  two  helpers.  Yes,  Horace Danby was good and respectable - but not completely honest.\n\nFifteen years ago, Horace had served his first and only sentence in a  prison  library.  He  loved  rare,  expensive  books.  So  he  robbed  a  safe every  year.  Each  year  he  planned  carefully  just  what  he  would  do, stole enough to last for twelve months, and secretly bought the books he loved through an agent.\n\nNow, walking in the bright  July  sunshine,  he  felt  sure  that  this year's  robbery  was  going  to  be  as  successful  as  all  the  others.  For two weeks he had been studying the house at Shotover Grange, looking at its rooms, its electric wiring, its paths and its garden. This afternoon the  two  servants,  who  remained  in  the  Grange  while  the  family  was in London, had gone to the movies. Horace saw them go, and he felt happy in spite of a little tickle of hay fever in his nose. He came out from  behind  the  garden  wall,  his  tools  carefully  packed  in  a  bag on his back.\n\nThere were about fifteen thousand pounds' worth of jewels in the Grange safe.

A  woman was standing in the  doorway,  and  Sherry  was  rubbing  against  her. She was young, quite pretty, and was dressed in red. She walked to the  fireplace  and  straightened  the  ornaments  there.\n\n'Down, Sherry,' she said. 'Anyone would think I'd been away for a month!' She smiled at Horace, and went on, 'However, I came back just in time, though I didn't expect to meet a burglar.'\n\nHorace had some hope because she seemed to be amused at meeting him. He might avoid trouble if he treated her the right way. He replied, 'I didn't expect to meet one of the family.'\n\nShe nodded. 'I see what an inconvenience it is for you to meet me. What are you going to do?'\n\nHorace said, 'My first thought was to run.'\n\n'Of course, you could do that. But I would telephone the police and tell them all about you.

On the morning of the third day, however, he thought  of  the  books  he wanted and he knew he would have to look for another safe. But he never got the chance to begin his plan. By noon a policeman had arrested him for  the  jewel  robbery  at Shotover Grange.\n\nHis  fingerprints,  for  he had opened the safe without gloves,  were  all  over  the room, and no one believed him when he said that the wife of the owner of the house had asked him to open the safe for her. The wife herself, a  gray-haired,  sharp-tongued  woman  of  sixty,  said  that  the  story was nonsense.\n\nHorace is now the assistant librarian in the prison. He often thinks of the charming, clever young lady who was in the same profession as he was, and who tricked him. He gets very angry when anyone talks about 'honour among thieves'.\n\nVICTOR CANNING\n\n![Image](outputs/jefp104/jefp104_artifacts/image_000008_13dff6f428dd0efe7745a6f3dddad3eb7376aebfd5734da04697bc8511715a58.png)","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T08:59:52.197957Z"}

What was a barefooted man doing on the steps of a house, in the middle of London? And where was the man?\n\nAs they gazed, a remarkable sight met their eyes. A fresh footmark appeared from nowhere!\n\nFurther footprints followed, one after another, descending the steps and progressing down the street. The boys followed, fascinated, until the  muddy  impressions  became  fainter  and  fainter,  and  at  last disappeared altogether.\n\nThe  explanation  of  the  mystery  was  really  simple  enough.  The bewildered boys had been following a scientist who had just discovered how to make the human body transparent.\n\nGriffin,  the  scientist,  had  carried  out  experiment  after  experiment to  prove  that  the  human  body  could  become  invisible.  Finally  he swallowed certain rare drugs and his body became as transparent as a sheet of glass - though it also remained as solid as glass.\n\nBrilliant  scientist  though  he  was,  Griffin  was  rather  a  lawless person.  His  landlord  disliked  him  and  tried  to  eject  him.  In  revenge Griffin set fire to the house. To get away without being seen he had to remove his clothes. Thus it was that he became a homeless wanderer, without  clothes,  without  money,  and  quite  invisible  -  until  he happened to step in some mud, and left footprints as he walked!\n\n5\n\nCan/.notdefa/.notdefman/.notdefbecome/.notdefinvisible?/.notdefThis/.notdefis/.notdefthe story/.notdefof a/.notdefscientist/.notdefwho/.notdefdiscovers/.notdefhow/.notdefto make/.notdefhimself invisible./.notdefDoes/.notdefhe/.notdefuse,/.notdefor misuse,/.notdefhis/.notdefdiscovery?","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:00:03.766614Z"}

They naturally gave chase. In the end he was able to escape only by quickly taking off his newlyfound clothes. So once more he found himself invisible but naked in the  chill  January  air.\n\nThis time he decided to try the stock of a theatrical company in the hope of finding  not  only  clothes  but  also  something  that  would  hide the  empty  space  above  his  shoulders.  Shivering  with  cold  he  hurried to Drury Lane, the centre of the theatre world.\n\nHe soon found a suitable shop. He made his way, invisible, upstairs and came out a little later wearing bandages round his forehead, dark glasses, false nose, big bushy side-whiskers, and a large hat.

A  stranger  of  such  uncommon  appearance  set  all tongues wagging. Mrs Hall, the landlord's wife, made every effort to be friendly. But Griffin had no desire to talk, and told her, 'My reason for coming to Iping is a desire for solitude. I do not wish to be disturbed in my work. Besides, an accident has affected my face.'\n\nSatisfied  that  her  guest  was  an  eccentric  scientist,  and  in  view  of the  fact  that  he  had  paid  her  in  advance,  Mrs  Hall  was  prepared  to excuse his strange habits and irritable temper. But the stolen money did  not  last  long,  and  presently  Griffin  had  to  admit  that  he  had  no more ready cash.  He  pretended,  however,  that  he  was  expecting  a cheque to arrive at any moment.\n\nShortly  afterwards  a  curious  episode  occurred.  Very  early  in  the morning a clergyman and his wife were awakened by noises in the study. Creeping downstairs, they heard the chink of money being taken from the clergyman's desk.\n\nWithout making any noise and with a poker grasped firmly in his hand, the clergyman flung open the door.\n\n'Surrender!'\n\n![Image](outputs/jefp105/jefp105_artifacts/image_000004_495b12c19554104c26180e15b7cdd6c94a76a4597fa5bcc1a88ec1d3acc15ed6.png)\n\nFootprints without Feet\n\n![Image](outputs/jefp105/jefp105_artifacts/image_000005_13dff6f428dd0efe7745a6f3dddad3eb7376aebfd5734da04697bc8511715a58.png)","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:00:03.766614Z"}

Richard H. Ebright and his college room-mate explained the theory in an article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.\n\nIt  was  the  first  time  this  important  scientific  journal  had  ever published the work of college students. In sports, that would be like making the big leagues at the age of fifteen  and  hitting  a  home  run your first  time  at  bat * .  For  Richard  Ebright,  it  was  the  first  in  a  long string  of  achievements  in  science  and  other  fields.  And  it  all  started with  butterflies.\n\nAn only  child,  Ebright  grew  up  north  of  Reading,  Pennsylvania. 'There  wasn't  much  I  could  do  there,'  he  said.  'I  certainly  couldn't play football or baseball with a team of one. But there was one thing I could do - collect things.'\n\nSo  he  did,  and  did  he  ever!  Beginning  in  kindergarten,  Ebright collected  butterflies  with  the  same  determination  that  has  marked  all his    activities.  He  also  collected  rocks,  fossils,  and  coins.  He  became an eager astronomer, too, sometimes star-gazing all night.\n\n* A home run in the game of baseball is when the batter scores a run after running safely around all bases and back to the home plate without stopping. A ball hit out of the playing field is also called a home run. Getting a paper published at the age of fifteen in a scientific journal is here compared to scoring a home run while batting for the first time.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:00:19.665934Z"}

They  were  asked  to  tag  butterflies  for  research  by  Dr Frederick  A. Urquhart of the University of Toronto, Canada. Ebright's mother wrote to Dr  Urquhart, and soon Ebright was attaching light adhesive tags to the wings of monarchs. Anyone who found a tagged butterfly was asked to send the tag to Dr Urquhart.\n\nThe butterfly  collecting  season  around  Reading  lasts  six  weeks  in late  summer. (See graph below.) If you're going to chase them one by one,  you  won't  catch  very  many.  So  the  next  step  for  Ebright  was  to raise a flock of butterflies. He would catch a female monarch, take her eggs, and raise them in his basement through their life cycle, from egg to caterpillar to pupa to adult butterfly. Then he would tag the butterflies' wings and let them go. For several years his basement was home to thousands of monarchs in different stages of development.\n\n![Image](outputs/jefp106/jefp106_artifacts/image_000005_86e666ec7434eaed11db2c3b2cc8e89d2029701b89ef119a26faadac8e9e2098.png)\n\n'Eventually I began to lose interest in tagging butterflies. It's tedious and there's not much feedback,' Ebright said. 'In all the time I did it,' he laughed, 'only two butterflies I had tagged were recaptured - and they were not more than seventy-five miles from where I lived.'","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:00:19.665934Z"}

Nevertheless,  her  dress  was  nearly  ready.  Her husband said to her one evening, 'What is the matter with you? You have acted strangely for two or three days.'\n\nAnd she responded, 'I am vexed not to have a jewel, nothing to adorn myself with. I shall have such a poverty-stricken look. I would prefer not to go to this party.'\n\nHe replied,  'You  can  wear  some  natural  flowers.  In  this  season they look very chic.'\n\nShe was not convinced. 'No', she replied, 'there is  nothing  more humiliating than to have a shabby air in the midst of rich women.'\n\nThen her husband cried out, 'How stupid we are! Go and find your friend Mme Forestier and ask her to lend you her jewels.'\n\nShe uttered a cry of joy. 'It is true!' she said. 'I had not thought of that.'\n\nThe next day she took herself to her friend's house and related her story  of  distress.  Mme  Forestier  went  to  her  closet,  took  out  a  large jewel-case, brought it, opened it, and said, 'Choose, my dear.'\n\nShe saw at first  some  bracelets,  then  a  collar  of  pearls,  then  a Venetian cross of gold and jewels of admirable workmanship. She tried the jewels before the glass, hesitated, but could neither decide to take them nor leave them. Then she asked, 'Have you nothing more?'\n\n'Why, yes. Look for yourself. I do not know what will please you.'\n\nSuddenly she discovered, in a black satin box, a superb necklace of diamonds. Her hands trembled as she took it out.  She placed it about her  throat  against  her  dress,  and  was  ecstatic.  Then  she  asked,  in  a hesitating voice, full of anxiety, 'Could you lend me this? Only this?'\n\n'Why, yes, certainly.'\n\n![Image](outputs/jefp107/jefp107_artifacts/image_000005_dfe08e5b2ddc05aea4094b326e6fdd8fed5f29e80346b7d3a9f4ffe17f88c74f.png)\n\nThe Necklace","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:00:36.837103Z"}

Mme Loisel was a great success. She was the prettiest of all - elegant, gracious, smiling and full of joy. All the men noticed her, asked her name, and wanted to be presented.\n\nShe danced with enthusiasm, intoxicated with pleasure, thinking of  nothing  but  all  this  admiration,  this  victory  so  complete  and  sweet to  her  heart.\n\nShe went home towards four o'clock in the morning. Her husband had been half asleep in one of the little  salons  since  midnight,  with three other gentlemen whose wives were enjoying themselves very much.\n\nHe threw around her shoulders the modest wraps they had carried whose poverty clashed with the elegance of the ball costume. She wished to hurry away in order not to be noticed by the other women who were wrapping themselves in rich furs.\n\nLoisel detained her, 'Wait,' said he. 'I am going to call a cab.'\n\nBut she would not listen and descended the steps rapidly. When they were in the street, they found no carriage; and they began to seek for one, hailing the coachmen whom they saw at a distance.\n\nThey walked along toward the river, hopeless and shivering. Finally they found one of those old carriages that one sees in Paris after nightfall.\n\nIt took them as far as their door and they went wearily up to their apartment. It  was  all  over  for  her.  And  on  his  part,  he  remembered that he would have to be at the office by ten o'clock.\n\nShe removed the wraps from her shoulders before the glass, for a final  view  of  herself  in  her  glory.

When she was ten months old, she had fallen off the cot on her head and perhaps it had damaged some part of her brain. That was why she remained a backward child and came to be known as Bholi, the simpleton.\n\nAt birth, the child was very fair and pretty.

Little  Sulekha  could  not  speak  till  she  was  five,  and  when  at last  she  learnt  to  speak,  she  stammered.  The  other  children  often made fun of her and mimicked her. As a result, she talked very little.\n\nRamlal  had  seven  children  -  three  sons  and  four  daughters,  and the youngest of them was Bholi. It was a prosperous farmer's household and there was plenty to eat and drink. All the children except Bholi were healthy and strong. The sons had been sent to the city to study in schools and later in colleges. Of the daughters, Radha, the eldest, had already been married. The second daughter Mangla's marriage had also been settled, and when that was done, Ramlal would think of the third, Champa. They were good-looking, healthy girls, and it was not difficult to find bridegrooms for them.\n\nBut Ramlal was worried about Bholi.

The  guests  began  to  whisper,  'So shameless! So ugly and so shameless!'\n\n'Bholi, are you crazy?' shouted Ramlal. 'You want to disgrace your family? Have some regard for our izzat!'\n\n'For the sake of your izzat,' said Bholi, 'I was willing to marry this lame old man. But I will not have such a mean, greedy and contemptible coward as my husband. I won't, I won't, I won't.'\n\n'What a shameless girl! We all thought she was a harmless dumb cow.' Bholi  turned  violently  on  the  old  woman,  'Yes,  Aunty,  you  are right. You all thought I was a dumb-driven cow. That's why you wanted to  hand  me  over  to  this  heartless  creature.  But  now  the  dumb  cow, the stammering fool, is speaking. Do you want to hear more?'\n\nBishamber Nath, the grocer, started to go back with his party. The confused bandsmen thought this was the end of the ceremony and struck up a closing song.\n\nRamlal stood rooted to the ground, his head bowed low with the weight of grief and shame.\n\nThe flames of the sacred fire slowly died down. Everyone was gone. Ramlal turned to Bholi and said, 'But what about you, no one will ever marry you now. What shall we do with you?'\n\nAnd Sulekha said in a voice that was calm and steady, 'Don't you worry, Pitaji ! In your old age I will serve you and Mother and I will teach in the same school where I learnt so much. Isn't that right, Ma'am?'\n\nThe teacher had all along stood in a corner, watching the drama. 'Yes,  Bholi,  of  course,'  she  replied.  And  in  her  smiling  eyes  was  the light of a deep satisfaction that an artist feels when contemplating the completion of her masterpiece.\n\nK.A.

The  sequence  of  bases  of  DNA  in each of our cells  is  the  same,  but  differs  from  that  of  any  other living thing except possibly an identical twin. This difference makes the  DNA  break  at  different  places  when  certain  proteins  called enzymes are added to it, resulting in  smaller  DNA  fragments  of different  sizes.  These  fragments  migrate  at  different  rates  in  an electric field, resulting in a unique pattern; this pattern is referred to as a DNA fingerprint.\n\nOur DNA is inherited from our parents. Some parts come from the father and some from the mother. DNA fingerprinting can help identify parentage, since a son or a daughter would always exhibit a  pattern  identifiable  as  coming  from  both  parents.  DNA fingerprinting  analysis  is  very  useful  in  forensic  science;  from  a single hair or a tiny spot of blood, it is possible to prove the innocence or guilt of a murder suspect. Similarly, it is also possible to identify human remains after violent accidents have caused disfigurement.\n\nIt has been suggested that in the not so distant future, a DNA fingerprinting  profile  of  the  individual  will  have  to  accompany applications for an ID card, a bank account and a driving license. Human right groups say this type of 'genetic profiling' constitutes an  invasion  of  privacy.  As  with  a  lot  of  new  technology,  DNA fingerprinting  also  has  a  potential  for  abuse.\n\n- (ii) Honeybees  are  very  sophisticated  at  position,  location  and navigation.  It  is  known  that  they  use  the  sun  as  a  guide.  They also appear to have a good memory. They convey the information of a new find of food to the hive through an amazingly clever dance language. The dance indicates the direction and distance of the food source with respect to the direction of the sun in the sky! If it is dark inside the hive and a light bulb is switched on, the dance is modified to include the light bulb as a new reference direction! Since bees have pictorial memory of some sort, a direction-finding mechanism and a way of reckoning distance, they are probably better equipped for getting back home than any of us!\n- (iii) Rain is the result of condensation of vapour when the air is cooled below the dew point. All the vapour in a cloud cannot condense at the same time and turn into a large pool of water. Pockets of air move up independently and slowly cool till condensation begins and water droplets form. It is believed that most raindrops start out  as  tiny  ice  crystals  -  so  tiny  that  they  float  down,  slowly accreting more moisture on the way; at lower altitudes, the crystals melt into water droplets. In colder climates, the crystals reach the ground as snowflakes.\n\n68\n\nFootprints without Feet","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:01:13.253859Z"}

A trader swore that even with a hundred attempts, the tailor would not be able to take a coil of thread from him without his knowledge.\n\nThe trader was told that many others, more intelligent than him,  had  been  beaten  by  the  tailor.  They  said  he  should  not imagine himself so great, for his ego would only give him worse troubles in competition with the tailor. Still, the trader became more competitive and made a wager that the tailor would not be able to rob him of anything.\n\nHe wagered an Arab horse with those who taunted him. If the  tailor  failed  to  steal,  then  they  would  have  to  give  him  a horse instead. That night, the trader lay awake troubled by the situation and could not sleep a wink.\n\nIn the morning, he put a piece of satin cloth under his arm and went to the bazaar and entered the shop and saluted the cunning rogue warmly. The tailor sprang up from his seat and welcomed the trader, inquiring about his health with cordiality exceeding  even  that  of  the  trader,  planting  in  his  heart  great feelings of affection for him. When the trader heard these songs of  sweetness  from  the  tailor,  he  flung  down  the  piece  of  silk saying, 'Cut this into a coat for me and make it wide below my navel so as not to hamper my legs and tight about it to show off my figure.'\n\nThe tailor answered, 'O! kindly man, I will do you a hundred services,' and accepted the order. He measured the satin and inspected  the working surface and all the time chatted away to the trader in idle gossip, about other amirs and of bounties and gifts he had received from them, and about misers and their mean ways, and made the trader laugh with hysterics. During this  beguiling  talk,  he  was  snipping  away  with  his  scissors rapidly, cutting as fast as his lips moved.\n\nW ORDS AND EXPR E SSIONS 2 ă C LASS X","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:01:51.059881Z"}

This helps in constructing ideas and analysing critical judgments of the peers to arrive at a decision or conclusion.\n\nIt would be of much benefit to learners, if projects planned are of an interdisciplinary nature.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:01:51.059881Z"}

The Germans continuously bombarded the city which resulted in death, destruction, and starvation of the people. However, the resolute Russians were warned in the beginning that the enemy was at the gate and it was a question of life and death. They fought bravely and failed the Germans in their evil designs.\n\nRead the excerpt and answer the questions that follow.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:02:42.320500Z"}

People's initial curiosity in the aftermath of the first bomb attacks soon gave way to fear and then, in conditions of appalling hunger and cold, to apathy. Leningraders welcomed inclement weather for the reduced visibility it brought. They came to dread sunny days and moonlit nights, when the Germans would be sure to bomb their city. Cloud cover,  however,  offered  no  protection from artillery fire: in just over six months from the start of the siege there were  only  thirty-two  days  when  shells did not explode on the city's streets.\n\nHunger soon set in. Between September and November 1941 the bread rations that had been announced in July were reduced five times, reaching their lowest point on 20 November  -  125 'blockade grams' for children, dependents and white-collar workers and 250g for manual workers, technicians and engineers.  Rations  of  meat,  butter,  sugar  and  other  food items  were  severely  reduced.  The  summer  months  and  the beginning  of  autumn,  when  it  was  still  possible  to  buy  food without ration cards in ordinary shops and canteens were no more than a distant memory.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:02:42.320500Z"}

It mattered not from whence it came; but all agreed it was come into Holland again.\n\nWe had no such thing as printed newspapers in those days to spread rumours and reports of things, and to improve them by the invention of men, as I have lived to see practiced since. But  such  things  as  these  were  gathered  from  the  letters  of merchants and others who corresponded abroad, and from them were handed about by word of mouth only; so that things did not spread instantly over the whole nation, as they do now.\n\nBut it seems that the Government had a true account of it, and several councils were held about ways to prevent its coming over; but all was kept very private. Hence, it was that this rumour died off again, and people began to forget it as a thing we were very  little  concerned  in,  and  that  we  hoped  was  not  true;  till the latter end of November or the beginning of December 1664 when two men, said to be Frenchmen, died of the plague in Long Acre, or rather at the upper end of Drury Lane. The family they were in endeavoured to conceal it as much as possible, but as it had gotten some vent in the discourse of the neighbourhood, the  Secretaries  of  State  got  knowledge  of  it;  and  concerning themselves to inquire about it, in order to be certain of the truth, two physicians and a surgeon were ordered to go to the house\n\nL\n\nA\n\nS","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:02:42.320500Z"}

Alexander  Selkirk,  the  Scottish  sailor  was marooned there for four years and four months. He related his experience to Daniel Defoe, who wrote his famous adventure book Robinson Crusoe based on the sailor's experience, since then the island is known as Robinson Crusoe.\n\nThere is a seemingly unbelievable true story of the orphaned bear  cub,  which  was  found  by  Polish  troops  during  World War II who travelled with them through Iraq, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Italy and Scotland. During the war, Wojciech Narebski and his fellow Polish servicemen had to lift crates of heavy metal artillery. Fortunately for them, one of the soldiers had superhuman strength: Corporal Wojtek, a Syrian brown bear. When the bear saw that soldiers were struggling, he'd want to help... he'd come over, grab a crate and carry it to the truck. This can be heavy work, even for a bear. When Wojtek (bear) got tired, he would simply stack one crate on top of the other which also helped the soldiers because they didn't have to lift the crate off the ground. Of course, Corporal Wojtek (bear) got a reward of honey and marmalade. That was his favourite!\n\nYou know, things can happen that you wouldn't normally think are true.

The reason the coffee is of such high quality is that it follows the best practices of bio-dynamic farming by creating an interconnected and symbiotic ecosystem.

Every being with a will to live has the right to live free from exploitation and suffering.\n\nAll animals have the ability to suffer in the same way and to the same degree that humans do. They feel pain, pleasure, fear, frustration, loneliness, and familial love. Whenever we consider doing something that would interfere with their needs, we are morally obligated to take them into account.\n\nPeople often ask if animal rights mean that animals should have the right to vote or drive a car. Of course, that would be silly because those aren't rights that would benefit animals. But animals have the right not to suffer at the hands of humans and to  live  their  lives  free  from  suffering  and  exploitation  because they have an interest in doing so. That is the difference between equal consideration and equal treatment.\n\nAlmost everyone cares about animals in some context, whether it's a beloved family companion, an irresistibly cute kitten or a majestic wild animal seen in a documentary.

They are all individuals, with the same capacity to feel pain and fear. Animal rights help us to look past the arbitrary distinctions between different species, to rediscover our innate compassion, and to respect all animals equally.\n\nAnyone  who  cares  about  animals  can  start  putting  these principles into practice every single day with the food they eat, the clothes they wear, and the products they buy.

One day a crow saw a swan. 'This swan is so white,' he thought, 'and I am so black. This swan must be the happiest bird in the world.'\n\nThe swan replied, 'I was feeling that I was the happiest bird around. But I think the parrot is the happiest bird as it has two colours.' The crow then approached the parrot. The parrot said, 'I have only two colours, but the peacock has multiple colours.'\n\nThe crow then visited a peacock in the zoo. 'Dear peacock,' the crow said, 'you are so beautiful. Every day, thousands of people come to see you. You are the happiest bird on the planet.'\n\nThe peacock said, 'I always thought that I was the most beautiful and happy bird on the planet. But I am entrapped in this zoo.

Originally  commissioned in  the  third  century  BCE  by  Emperor  Ashoka,  this  huge hemispherical dome consists of a central chamber. In this chamber, the relics of Lord Buddha are placed. The original construction work of this stupa was supervised by Ashoka. His  wife,  Devi,  was  the  daughter  of  a  merchant  of  nearby village, Vidisha. Sanchi was also her birthplace as well as the venue of her and Ashoka's wedding. Later, four ornamental gateways or toranas facing four directions and a balustrade surrounding  the  stupa  were  added  in  the  first  century BCE. The Great stupa at Sanchi is one of the oldest stone structures in India and counted among the best conserved ancient stupas of Central India.

Do you get upset when you lose a game? Do you crib when your teacher does not pay attention to you? Most of us can have 'yes' as an answer to one or more of these situations. Anger sometimes gets the better of us and leaves us to regret the consequences later. The question is 'How can we control anger?'\n\nAnger is a normal and healthy emotion only if we know how to respond to it.

Before we learn to address the issue, let us revisit the concept of anger. Anger is nothing but absence of peace with oneself, people or situations around us. We express it either by being assertive or aggressive.\n\nLet us all become the managers of our own anger. When angry, take\ta\tfew\tmoments\tto\tcalm\tdown\t(take\tfive\tdeep\tbreaths,\tcount up to ten, drink water, change your place) before responding. More often than not we do not have control over the situations that distress us. Getting physically active reduces stress. Funny dances,  clapping,  thumping  your  feet,  a  walk,  making  funny faces at the mirror, etc., go a long way in helping us let go of the anger or the frustration  inside  us.  Once  we  have  our  feelings under control, go through all the aspects of the situation and try to see the same situation from different perspectives. If it is a problem try to equip yourself with a few solutions before entering the same situation. Avoid holding a grudge with people and learn when to seek help from others. Realising your own shortcomings can become one of the greatest strengths of character over the years to come.\n\nWe can never control circumstances, people or situations as they are constantly changing. The only thing we can control is our response. So we have to increase our capacity to tolerate, ability to understand, and learn to nurture love for others.\n\n- Q.1.

There is physical violence  and  also  inward  violence.  Physical  violence  is  to  kill another, to hurt other people consciously, deliberately or without thought, to say cruel things, full of antagonism and hate and inwardly, inside the skin, to dislike  people,  to  hate  people,  to criticise people. Inwardly, we are always quarrelling, battling, not only with others, but with ourselves. We want people to change, we want to force them to our way of thinking.\n\nIn the world, as we grow up, we see a great deal of violence, at all levels of human existence. The ultimate violence is war  -  the killing for ideas, for so-called religious principles, for nationalities, the killing to preserve a little piece of land. To do that, man will kill, destroy, maim, and also be killed himself. There is enormous violence in the world, the rich wanting to keep people poor, and the poor wanting to get rich and in the process hating the rich. And you, being caught in society, are also going to contribute to this.\n\nThere is violence between husband, wife, and children. There is violence, antagonism, hate, cruelty, ugly criticism, anger  -  all this  is  inherent  in  man,  inherent  in  each  human  being.  It  is\n\nLook Up and Understand antagonism consciously deliberately inherent maim\n\n![Image](outputs/jewe209/jewe209_artifacts/image_000009_fbbddf44ea720be7b8784165b17512f500f8b87bc4c8313ccd350dd3320b5d69.png)","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:04:25.677182Z"}

And education is supposed to help you to go beyond all that, not merely to pass an examination and get a job. You have to be educated so that you become a really beautiful, healthy, sane, rational human being, not a brutal man with a very clever brain who can argue and defend his brutality. You are going to face all this violence as you grow up. You will forget all that you have heard here, and will be caught in the stream of society. You will become like the rest of the cruel, hard, bitter, angry, violent world, and you will not help to bring about a new society, a new world.\n\nBut a new world is necessary. A new culture is necessary. The old culture is dead, buried, burnt, exploded, and vaporised. You  have  to  create  a  new  culture.  A  new  culture  cannot  be based on violence. The new culture depends on you because the older generation has built a society based on violence, based on aggressiveness and it is this that has caused all the confusion, all the misery. The older generations have produced this world and you have to change it. You cannot just sit back and say, 'I will follow the rest of the people and seek success and position.' If  you  do,  your  children  are  going  to  suffer.  You  may  have  a good  time,  but  your  children  are  going  to  pay  for  it.  So,  you have to take all that into account, the outward cruelty of man to man in the name of god, in the name of religion, in the name of self-importance, in the name of the security of the family. You will have to consider the outward cruelty and violence, and the inward violence which you do not yet know.\n\n(Source: 'On Violence', On Education by J.

He didn't go to bed on Christmas Eve. When everyone in the shop had gone to Church, he began to  write  on  a  crumpled sheet of paper. 'Dear Grandfather Konstantin, he wrote', I'm writing a letter to you. I wish you a Merry Christmas and all good things from the Lord God. I've no father and mother, and you are all I have left.')\n\nVanka  raised  his  eyes  to  the  dark  windowpane.  In  his imagination  he  saw  his  grandfather  Konstantin  standing there. His grandfather was a night watchman on the estate of a rich man. Konstantin was a small, thin and lively old man of\tsixty-five\twhose\tface\twas\talways\tcrinkling\twith\tlaughter. In  the  daytime  the  old  man  slept  in  the  servant's  kitchen or cracked jokes with the cooks. At night, wrapped in a big sheepskin coat he made rounds of the estate, blowing his whistle at regular intervals. He was always followed by his dogs, Brownie and Eel. Eel was a particularly remarkable dog. He was extremely respectful and endearing and looked lovingly on friends and strangers alike; yet no one trusted him. He would creep behind someone and bite his leg or run off  with a peasant's chicken. Many a time Eel was beaten mercilessly, yet he always managed to survive.\n\nAt  this  very  moment,  Vanka  thought,  grandfather  was probably standing by the gates, looking up at the bright red windows of the village church and cracking jokes with the servants.\n\n'What about a pinch of snuff?' he would say, holding out his snuffbox to the women.\n\nThe women would take a pinch and sneeze and the old man would feel happy about it. 'Fine for frozen noses, eh!' he'd say.\n\nThe dogs, too,  were  given  snuff.  Brownie  would  sneeze, shake her head and walk away looking hurt. Eel, too polite to sneeze, only wagged his tail.\n\nVanka  looked  through  the  window.  The  weather  was glorious. The air was fresh. The night was very dark, but the roofs of the houses and trees were all covered with snow.\n\n![Image](outputs/jewe209/jewe209_artifacts/image_000023_37fa4c351784eb90689c9e1942d73fa8aaebf9cbec52c618cc9602d2114e7bf9.png)\n\n![Image](outputs/jewe209/jewe209_artifacts/image_000024_540df44b6c20ac4f426ccb1e4a72d45c196f60347a940f3596896bbf95c8c1bd.png)","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:04:25.677182Z"}

That was because when I was rocking the baby in  the  cradle,  I  unfortunately  fell  asleep.

I sleep in the corridor and when the baby cries, I don't get any sleep at all because I've to rock the cradle.

If you think there's no place for me then I can clean boots or even work as a shepherd boy. Grandfather, it's more than I can bear. I thought of running away to the village, but I don't have any boots. If you'll help me now, I'll feed you when I grow up and when you die I'll pray for your soul just like I do for my mother.\n\n'Dear Grandfather, when they put up the Christmas tree at the big house, please take down a golden walnut for me and hide it in the green box. Ask the young mistress Olga, and say it is for Vanka.'\n\nVanka sighed and gazed in the direction of the window. He remembered it was grandfather who always went to the forest to cut down a Christmas tree for the rich people, taking Vanka with him. They had a wonderful time together, the snow falling, the trees crackling and hares springing across the trees,\n\nWhen the tree had been chopped down, grandfather would drag it to the big house and they would start decorating it. The young mistress Olga, Vanka's favourite, was the busiest of  all.  Vanka's  mother,  when  alive,  had  worked  as  Olga's maid. Then Olga had given him all the sweets and played a lot with Vanka. But after his mother's death, Vanka was sent to the kitchen to be with his grandfather and from there to Alyakhin, the shoemaker.\n\nL\n\nA\n\nS","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:04:25.677182Z"}

Central Advisory Board of Physical Education and Recreation  defines  PE  as  'an  education  through  physical activities  for  the  development  of  total  personality  of  the child to its fullness and perfection in body, mind and spirit. Physical education is an area through which sports, outdoor activities like trekking, hiking, camping, gymnastics, dance, aquatics  are  used  to  train  individuals  in  motor  skills  and fitness skills. Physical education also assists the schools in carrying out responsibility of developing personal and social skills  in  students.'  In  fact,  PE  is  an  integral  part  of  total education.

Contrary to the widely held assumption that sport and other activities cut upon the time for serious school study, research evidence has shown that students tend to do better in school when they participate in physical activities. There is a positive correlation between performance in sport and the level of academic achievement. Physical education including sport is an integral part of the social  and  cultural  infrastructure  of  a  nation.  It  really  can make a difference in the broader educational process and in changing and enhancing the quality of life. Vigorous physical exercise stimulates circulation, helps prevent skin eruptions and  increases  fluid  intake.  These  exercises  also  promote self-worth and mental health, and support an individual for healing an injury. Sport also enhances physical performance and induce positive physiological adaptation. When children exercise,  their  fitness  needs  are  met,  and  build  up  energy to  learn  and  achieve.  Given the growing number of children with  obesity,  watching  TV,  continuously  being  involved  in computer  games  and  other  unwanted  activities,  frequency of  the  children  getting  involved  in  physical  achievement and academic performance, has taken a back seat. Physical exercise enhances the function in joints, increases the sense of physical well being and promotes a sense of feeling good. It also increases physical working capacity by increasing cardiorespiratory  fitness  and  increased  strength  and  endurance and decreases risk of serious disease that could lead to early disability and death.\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp101/jehp101_artifacts/image_000015_e96a10a101efdc0299d05afd35a94778c992ccd2eaf2f618c8682c16830133ab.png)","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:04:58.690919Z"}

You are aware that a healthy individual is one who has a healthy mind in a healthy body. This  state  of  health  can  be  achieved  when  various  organ systems  of  the  body  function  in  harmony.  For  example, physical activities are based on motor movements and their co-ordination. The command for movements comes from the brain which is a part of the nervous system. The required energy for movements and other activities is obtained from food. Food is completely digested in the intestine, a part of digestive system. Food and oxygen reach all the parts of body through the action of heart, which is a part of the circulatory system. In fact, many organ systems of the body function as an integrated whole for healthy maintenance of the body.\n\nYou  have  already  studied  about  organ  systems  of  the human body in the previous science classes. In this chapter, the  organ  systems  have  been  discussed  in  relation  to  the effect of physical activities. It is a common experience that performance  in  any  event,  sports  or  otherwise,  depends upon  physical  health,  as  well  as,  mental  and  emotional health.  Development and maintenance of physical, mental and  emotional  health  specially  during  this  coronavirus (COVID-19) is therefore, very important.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:05:19.843067Z"}

These are called voluntary muscles,  such  as,  those  of  the  limbs  and  the  neck.  The involuntary  muscles,  such  as,  those  lining  the  food  canal, move automatically without our efforts for making them move. Another kind of muscles, which are also involuntary, are the muscles  of  the  heart  or  cardiac  muscles  which  never  stop contracting and relaxing. As learnt in earlier classes, muscle cells (muscle fibres) may be striated (voluntary) muscle fibres, unstriated  (involuntary)  muscle  fibres  and  cardiac  muscle fibres (Fig.2.4). Muscles are grouped into bundles enclosed in a membrane. Movement of muscles takes place by the movement of molecules of muscle proteins, called actin and myosin present in the muscle fibres. Upon receiving instructions from the brain and nerves, these proteins slide over each other and the muscle contracts.  Muscle  contraction  uses  up  energy,  which  comes from food. It is measured in calories.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:05:19.843067Z"}

Whenever physical activities, games or sport are undertaken there is contraction of muscles and increase in energy level due to breakdown of ATP.\n\nThe  beneficial  effects  of  regular  physical  activities  are listed below -\n\n- Change in shape and size of the muscle fibres: Muscle fibres enlarge with physical activities which cause an overall  enlargement  of  muscles  with  the  change  in its  size  and  shape.  The  size  of  muscles  increases  by 60  per  cent.    It  is  because  of  this  reason  that,  the muscles of arms of a tennis player are well developed.\n- Maintenance  of  muscle  tone: Muscles  are  stimulated to contract by signals from nerves. Due to continuous signals, when  physical exercises are undertaken, muscles remain in partial  state  of  contraction  called muscle tone. Hence, regular physical activities maintain good muscle tone and enhance physical fitness.\n- Increase  in  muscle  proteins: The  units of  muscle contraction  are  proteins.  Physical  activities  lead  to increase in total proteins.\n- Increase in blood capillaries: Regular physical exercises lead to increase in number of blood capillaries supplying blood to muscles.\n- Increase in efficiency of ligaments and tendons: Ligaments  and  tendons  become  more  efficient  as  a result of regular physical activity. This improves muscle movements  resulting  in  greater  tolerance  of  stress during strenuous activity.\n- Long term increase in muscle strength: Regular physical exercises increase and maintain strength of muscles. This increases speed of contraction as in the case of marathon runner and also work well against load as in the case of weight lifter.\n- Delay  in  muscle  fatigue: Muscles  need  oxygen  to contract. But when muscles are used for a long time during  sport,  available  oxygen  gets  used  up  and lactic  acid  accumulates.  This  causes  muscle  fatigue. It is, therefore, important to do physical activities like stretching to delay muscle fatigue.\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp102/jehp102_artifacts/image_000016_62b34cb1bc26bb52110b1dae713bdb8511b50b8561c39d0dfa6db54e945680cb.png)","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:05:19.843067Z"}

At  the same time, oxygen gets speedily used up, this creates an oxygen debt, as the rate of oxygen intake may not match the oxygen requirement due to the exercise. Thus, maximum exercises are followed by a recovery period when oxygen debt is removed by obtaining more oxygen.  For example, when an athlete is running and requires 3 litres of oxygen, if oxygen obtained is only 2 litres, oxygen debt of 1 litre is created, which gets recovered during recovery period.\n\n- Overall improvement in efficiency of muscle movements and  reaction time: Muscles contract on receiving stimulus from nerves.

Sex hormones stimulate growth and maturity of gonads (reproductive organs).  In  males,  testes  grow  in  size  and start producing sperms. In females, the eggs or ova present in the ovary since birth begins to mature.  Sex organs also increase in size. Thus, there is an overall growth in body size. As sexual maturity progresses during adolescence, hormones act  on  growth  centers  of  bones  which  are  responsible  for increase in length of bones. The long bones, the vertebrae and limbs grow and the adolescent gains height. The limbs become stronger. The heart, lungs and other internal organs also  grow  to  match  the  increase  in  body  size.  The  muscle mass undergoes a spurt at adolescence. Eventually, growth rate slows down and then stops. Generally, at the age of 14 to 18 years of age, adult height is already reached. The peak of growth of muscle mass is also typically around the age of 14 to 16 years. In the females, the pelvis region undergoes a growth spurt and becomes wider.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:05:41.874392Z"}

The word 'social' is associated with the word 'society'. As adolescence sets in, a boy or girl becomes psychologically aware of self and society. As a result, the adolescents build their own image and personality. This gives confidence to the adolescent to move in the society.\n\nAdolescence is a transitional phase between childhood and adulthood.  During  this  transitional  period  the  adolescents get  confused  regarding  their  emerging  role  in  the  family and  society  at  large.  The  physical  changes  in  adolescents are  accompanied by psychosocial changes. Adolescents get attracted  towards  opposite  sex  or  become  part  of  a  peer group. Such changes tend to make them more dependent on the peer group in neighborhood, among classmates, etc. This often  creates  stressful  relationships  with  parents,  teachers and elders. Sometimes these developments may make them insecure  about  future.  Adolescents  who  become  aware  of these changes, overcome this phase comfortably.\n\nThe  social  changes  are  reflected  in  the  behavior  of adolescents with peers and parents. They differ from parents on  many  issues  and  develop  the  confidence  to  express their  own  opinion  emphatically  if  parents  are  friendly  and understanding.    Adolescents  are  more  friendly  with  their peer  group.  However  belonging  to  a  vulnerable  age  group, adolescents  may  feel  pressurised  under  the  influence  of peers.    Everyone  feels  the  need  to  have  friends  but  during adolescence  the  need  for  friendship  is  more  pronounced. The friendship may be with a peer or relative of one's own age and someone of own sex or the other sex. It is, therefore, important  for  them  to  identify  with  whom  they  can  share their  ideas  and  identify  'safety  net'  in  friends,  parents  and teachers.\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp103/jehp103_artifacts/image_000008_c19ec65c43d485bc178d19389c10fd035cb6e1c1182aa93bfa36aa8969fefd04.png)\n\n29\n\nSome psychological changes that occur in an adolescent are mentioned here.

However,  the reproductive maturity is reached only when a teenager is fully developed physically and physiologically. In India, because of early marriage, there are large number of adolescents or teenage  pregnancies.  If  pregnancy  occurs  before  reaching complete  reproductive  maturity,  girls  may  risk  their  own health and that of the fetus (developing embryo).\n\nRisks  involved  in  adolescent  pregnancy  are  mentioned below -\n\n- An  adolescent  mother  is  not  mentally  prepared  for motherhood.\n- An adolescent mother is likely to be anemic.\n- An adolescent mother is more prone towards maternal death while giving birth.\n- Infant death are more among teenage mothers.\n- There is likelihood of developing complications during giving birth.\n- The baby born from teenage mother requires greater care which the teenage mother may not be able to give.\n- The reproductive tract may be damaged during childbirth.\n- Early pregnancy and motherhood delays development of education and career of adolescent mother.\n- There may be economic problems and also problems due  to  psychological  immaturity  of  the  adolescent mother. This may hamper proper care of the infant.\n\nActivity 3.3\n\nRead the case study given below.

Rahul  was  in  college  and  Sangeeta  had  yet  to finish school when they got married. After six months Sangeeta discovered that she was pregnant.

Sphygmomanometer consists  of  cuff  with an inflatable bladder which is wrapped around a person's upper arm and a rubber bulb inflates the bladder. An attached device indicates the blood pressure.

Running,  jumping  and  throwing  have  been universal forms of human physical activities since the human beings exist. The first recorded example of organised track and  field  events  is  found  in  the  Ancient  Olympic  Games held in 776 BC. The starting of the modern Olympic Games at  Greece  in  1896  was  marked  as  new  era  for  track  and field  events  which  was  initiated  by  Pierre-de-Coubertin. Until the early 1920s, only males were participating in the track and field  events.  Introduction  of  five  track  and  field  events for women in the athletics was started during 1928 Summer Olympics. Gradually more women's events were introduced as time progressed. However, it was only towards the second half of the twentieth century that the men's and women's track and field events were given equal status. Furthermore, major track and field  events  for  disabled  athletes  were  first  introduced at the 1960 Summer Para Olympics. From 1990's onwards, track and field events became increasingly more professional.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:06:08.170958Z"}

Long jump: The long jump is one of the oldest field events.  The  take-off  has  to  be  made  from  a  20  cm wide  board  one  meter  away  from  a  pit.    Athletes sprint along a length of track to a take off board and a sandpit. If any part of the runner's foot goes past the takeoff board, the jumper is considered for a foul and does not receive score for that round. Distance is measured from the end of the takeoff board to the nearest mark made by the jumper on the pit.  Best eight  competitors  have  a  maximum  of  six  rounds. Professional long jumpers typically have strong acceleration and sprinting abilities. However, athletes must also have a consistent stride to allow them to take off near the board while still maintaining their maximum speed.\n2. Triple jump: Similar to the long jump, the triple jump takes  place  on  a  field  heading  towards  a  sandpit. This  event  is  termed  as  the  'hop-step  and  jump.' The event begins like a long jump, with competitor dashing down the runway and leaping from a takeoff board they first hop then take a step and then jump into  the  pit.  The  event  is  scored  identically  to  the long jump.\n\nFig. 4.11: Long jump\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp104/jehp104_artifacts/image_000018_d07a0db3c28722eca66f1ae959bd802d992b4c37ea8eea4b2a6cbda4fe667b4e.png)\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp104/jehp104_artifacts/image_000019_6ac84b97f6acb12ff5071527cf908343261ee9b7ef9119e45b2d04384d4e4159.png)","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:06:08.170958Z"}

High jump: In high jump event, competitors combined speed,  to  generate  lift,  with  jumping  technique.

In between, they must  clear the 4-meter-long bar without  knocking  it  off  its  supports.  The  bar  will originally be set at a low height, at which competitors may choose to jump, or pass to another height. The bar  is  raised  to  a  predetermined  height  after  each round. Each competitor who either clears or passes a  height  advances  to  the  next  round.    They  are ranked according to the height they clear. An athlete is allowed a maximum of three trials of each height. Competitors are eliminated after missing (failing) three consecutive  jumps  in  a  particular  height.  Athletes have a short run up and then take off from near one foot to jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto a  cushioned  landing  area.  Jumping  technique  has played a significant part in the history of the event. The modern technique of high jump as shown in the figure is known as 'Fosbury Flop'.\n4. Pole vault: Each vaulter sprints down the runway with a fiberglass or carbon fiber pole and plants the pole into the vaulting box. This box is specifically made of\n\nFig. 4.13: High jump\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp104/jehp104_artifacts/image_000021_1a79591094dc236687cb17a1f1ef7ddff681becff95799d7055f92be0a7fa66c.png)\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp104/jehp104_artifacts/image_000022_4b8d4253c2e84b5be75ac59216026feb2510a9b4a2c0d1b11624a0321ea481b7.png)\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp104/jehp104_artifacts/image_000023_578c96deec07b60376534920d33276b19426421f40223750acc6a8c62349e9b2.png)\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp104/jehp104_artifacts/image_000024_32cca2e8da335bc391010263d48874bd619866d2c0edb21093b15dda83e24551.png)\n\nJump phase","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:06:08.170958Z"}

Discus: In the discus event the athlete stands inside a throwing circle of 2.5 mt (8'-2½') diameter. As per technique he/she turns around one and a half times and throws the disc as far as he or she can.  The disc is a round plate made of wood and metal and weighs 2 Kg for men and 1 Kg for women.  When throwing the discus, the athlete must remain in circle. The feet of the athlete cannot leave this area before the discus lands.    Even  afterwards  the  athlete  must  leave  the circle from rear half of the circle.  Otherwise it is a fault and the throw will not be counted. The athlete will spin around to gain momentum, speed and then releases the disc in the proper direction. The athlete that throws it furthest from the front part of the circle (and within the legal area) wins the event.\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp104/jehp104_artifacts/image_000027_b566be5f8f3f3d14253a3d659e8430692561e2633a68dcd733d07d9c718234e2.png)","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:06:08.170958Z"}

Hammer Throw: The hammer throw doesn't actually involve  throwing  a  hammer  like  you  would  think. In  this  throwing  event  the  athletes  throw  a  heavy ball (7.265 Kg for men and 4 Kg for women) that is attached to a handle with a long (4 feet) wire.

However, that would not improve their position in the standings.\n- After all competitors have cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar height will be raised.\n- The height of the bar raised is predetermined before the competition.  Though  when  one  competitor  remains, that competitor may choose their own selected height for  the  remaining  attempts.  A  record  is  kept  of  each attempt by each competitor.\n- After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one who jumps the highest height is the winner. The bar does not shift to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions  are  still  tied  after  applying  the  tiebreakers, all tied competitors will take a fourth jump at the last height.\n- If  they still miss, the bar will go down one increment where they will again jump.

Service: There are basically three types of serves high, low and flat. High service is the most basic of all  strokes.  One  needs  to  learn  this  first  when  one starts playing the game. You need to concentrate on the following three broad points while delivering the high service.\n- Stance: To deliver the high service, the player has to take a position about two feet from the short service line and about six inches from the centre line.\n- The  player  has  to  make  sure  not  to  touch  the centre line as it will be called a touch fault. The player  has  to  stand  comfortably  with  both  feet spread apart and parallel to each other and take the initial serving position. At this stage, the full weight of the body is on the back foot.\n- Point  of  Contact:  As  one  starts  the  forward movement of the racket, slowly start shifting the weight from the back foot to the front foot. The player then drops the shuttle and hit it high and\n\nFig. 5.3: Backhand grip\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp105/jehp105_artifacts/image_000007_9a3755a9ce6e339d6c3fb55d6bd82b9bdfde29c321b1387fcee5c0a61ca7228d.png)\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp105/jehp105_artifacts/image_000008_93c2026dc027ae0d734174b81d81278e590df7bed2d377d29719e6ebbf70d2d9.png)","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:06:40.388725Z"}

The player must make sure that the point of contact is always below the waist.\n- Follow-through: Once the service is delivered, the player continues to swing the racket right across the left shoulder (or right shoulder if the player is left-handed). This is called the follow through.\n3. Return of Service: This stroke plays a crucial part in a rally because good return of serve allows a player to dictate terms and control a rally till the point is won. However weak return of serve will allow the opponent to go on the offensive. While receiving the serve to hit the shuttle, normally players stand in the centre of the court with the left foot forward and place the weight of  the  body  more  on  the  front  foot.  It  will  help  the player to receive all types of serves i.e. high, low and flick. In fact, players are advised to take the stance closer to the short service because in high serve the shuttle remains in the air for a longer duration. On a  high  serve,  a  player  has  the  choice  of  playing  an attacking clear, drop shot, smash or a half smash. Similarly, on a low serve, a player can flick, push or lift the shuttle to the baseline. It is important to try to meet the shuttle as close to the net as possible so that the receiver has more options available to choose the shots.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:06:40.388725Z"}

Events for men\n\n- (i)  Floor  Exercise:  For  this  event  a  12×12  square spring  floor  is  required.  A  series  of  tumbling passes  are  performed  to  demonstrate  flexibility, strength,  and  balance.  The  gymnast  must  also show strength skills, including circles, scales, and press  handstands.  Men's  floor  routines  usually have  four  passes  that  will  total  between  50-70 seconds and are performed without music. As per rules,  male  gymnasts  touch  each  corner  of  the floor at least once during their routine.\n- (ii)  Pommel  Horse:  A  typical  pommel  horse  exercise involves  both  single  leg  and  double  leg  skills. Single leg skills are generally found in the form of scissors, often done on the pommels. Double leg skill,  however,  is  the  main  staple  of  this  event. The gymnast swings both legs in a circular motion (clockwise or counterclockwise depending on preference) and performs such skills on all parts of  the  apparatus.  Gymnasts  will  often  include variations on a typical circling skill by turning or by straddling their legs.  This makes the exercises of gymnast more challenging. A gymnast performs a dismount, either by swinging his body over the horse or landing after a handstand.\n- (iii)  Still Rings: The rings are attached to a wire cable from a point to 5.75 meters from the floor, and adjusted in height so, that the gymnast has room to hang freely and swing.

At  least  one  static strength  move  is  required,  but  some  gymnast includes two or three strenghts. A routine should have a dismount at the end of routine.\n- (iv)  Vault: In this, the gymnasts sprint down a runway, which is a maximum of 25 meters in length, before hurdling onto a spring board. The body position is maintained while 'punching' (blocking using only a shoulder movement) the vaulting board. The gymnast then rotates to a standing position. Multiple twists and somersaults are added before landing in case of advance gymnastics. Vaults depend on the speed of the run, the length of the hurdle, the power the gymnast generated from the legs and shoulder girdle and the kinesthetic awareness in the air. In case of more difficult and complex vaults the speed of rotation is more important.\n- (v)  Parallel Bars: Men perform on  two  bars.  These  are kept  slightly  further  than a  shoulder's  width  apart and usually 1.75 m high. For executing a series of swings, balances, and releases require great strength and coordination.\n- (vi)  Horizontal Bar: A 2.8 cm thick steel or fiberglass bar raised 2.5m above the landing area is all the gymnasts have to hold onto as they perform giants (revolutions around the bar), release skills, twists, and  changes  of  direction.  By  using  all  of  the momentum from giants and then releasing at the proper point, enough height can be achieved for spectacular dismounts. Leather grips are usually used to help maintain a grip on the bar.\n\nFig. 5.5: Vault\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp105/jehp105_artifacts/image_000012_34821ed9052c7ab50f7f92d0cfa617c81b77f5412c86ece2dfae9da8e4d1633e.png)\n\nFig. 5.6: Parallel bars\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp105/jehp105_artifacts/image_000013_87c784c37408263866a7c4eb78ebd3d7594e654c81547c57a9b7c60c10a73dc9.png)","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:06:40.388725Z"}

Then they spring off this platform to a two footed landing. Every gymnast starts at a different point on the vault runway depending on her height and strength. The post flight segment may include one or  more  multiple  somersaults,  and/or  twisting movements.  In  vaults  with  round-off  entries, gymnasts  'round-off'  so  that  hands  are  on  the runway while the  feet  land  on  the  springboard. From the round-off position the gymnast travels backwards as in a back handspring so that the hands  land  on  the  vaulting  platform  (horse). She  then  blocks  off  the  vaulting  platform  into various twisting and somersaulting combinations.\n- (iii)  Uneven Bars: On the uneven bars (also known as asymmetric bars), the gymnast performs a routine on two horizontal bars set at different heights. The height  is  generally  fixed,  but  the  width  may  be adjusted. Gymnasts  perform  swinging,  circling, transitional,  and  release  moves,  as  well  as  moves that pass through the handstand. Usually in higher levels of gymnastics, leather grips are worn to ensure that the gymnast maintains a grip on the bar, and to protect the hands from blisters and tears.\n- (iv)  Balance Beam: The gymnast performs a choreographed  routine  from  70  to  90  seconds in  length  consisting  of  leaps,  acrobatic  skills, turns  and  dance  elements  on  a  padded  spring beam.

Table  Tennis  was  probably  played with  improvised  equipment  in  England  during  the  last quarter of  19th  century.  Evidence  show  that  David  Foster in England patented an action game of Tennis on Table in 1890.  One  year  later  John  Jaques  came  out  with  a  game called Gossima. In 1900, a celluloid ball was introduced by Jaques and the name was given as 'Ping-Pong'. Table Tennis is controlled by ITTF (International Table Tennis Federation) which was founded in 1926 with headquarters in Berlin. It was introduced in Olympics in 1988 in Seoul, South Korea. First  World  Championship  of  Table-Tennis  was  held  in London in 1926. TTFI (Table-Tennis Federation of India) was formed in 1926 in Calcutta, now known as Kolkata.\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp105/jehp105_artifacts/image_000017_bafe9e324626e5f9401f681d37f8adb792a5ceb9e531910b1b60342d29ef2a0f.png)","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:06:40.388725Z"}

Types of strokes: The two types of strokes are offensive and  defensive  including  backhand  and  forehand.\n- (i)  Offensive strokes (drive, loop drive, loop, loop kill, hook, counter drive, flip and smash)\n- a)  Drive:  The  racket  is  primarily  perpendicular to the direction of the stroke, and most of the energy  applied  to  the  ball  results  in  speed rather  than  spin,  creating  a  shot  that  does not arc much, but it is fast enough to make it difficult to return.\n- b)  Loop drive: The racket is much more parallel to the direction of the stroke (closed) and the racket thus grazes the ball, resulting in a large amount  of  topspin.  Variations  in  spin  and speed add to the effectiveness of this shot.\n- c)  Loop: The loop produces a more pronounced loopy arc, with a higher trajectory and extreme topspin, but is typically slower.\n- d)  Loop kill: The loop kill produces a flatter arc, with  higher  speed  that  resembles  a  speed drive but with stronger topspin.\n- e)  Hook: It is similar to a regular Loop, but carries a tilted topspin (or is referred as the 'top-side' spin),  it  bounces  sideways  and  downward upon hitting the table.\n- f)  Counter drive: It is a counter attack against drives  (normally  high  loop  drives).

The racket is held closed and near to the ball, which is hit with a short movement off the bounce (before reaching  the  highest  point)  so  that  the  ball travels faster to the other side.\n- g)  Flip: When a player tries to attack a ball that has not bounced beyond the edge of the table, however the ball may still be attacked, and the resulting shot is called flip because the back swing is compressed into a quick wrist action.\n- h)  Smash:  Smash  is  executed  when  his  or  her opponent has returned a ball that bounces too high  and/  or  too  close  to  the  net.  Smashing is  a  large  back  swing  and  rapid  acceleration imparting as much speed on the ball as possible.\n- (ii)  Defensive strokes\n- a)  Push  or  Slice:  The  push  is  usually  used  for keeping the point alive and creating offensive opportunities. A push resembles a tennis slice, the racket cuts underneath the ball, imparting backspin and causing the ball to float slowly to the other side of the table. Offensive players should  only  push  for  variation  and  not  for general rallies.\n- b)  Chop: A chop or cut is the defensive, backspin counterpart to the offensive loop drive. A chop is essentially a bigger, heavier slice, taken well back  from  the  table.  Sometimes  a  defensive player can impart no spin on the ball during a chop, or frequently add right- or left-hand spin to the ball. This may further confuse his/ her opponent.\n- c)  Block: A block is executed by simply putting the racket in front of the ball, the ball rebounds back  toward  the  opponent  with  nearly  as much energy as it came in with. This is not as easy as it sounds, because the ball's spin, speed, and location, all influence the correct angle of a block.\n- d)  Side spin drive: The premise of this move is to put a spin on the ball either to the right or the left  of  the  racket.  The  execution  of  this  move is  similar  to  a  slice,  but  to  the  right  or  left, instead of down. This spin will result in the ball curving to the side but bouncing in the opposite direction when the opponent returns it.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:06:40.388725Z"}

A High Ball is inherently a creative shot, and can have nearly any kind of spin.\n- f)  Drop shot: The drop shot is a high level stroke, used  as  another  variation  for  close-to-table strokes. The player has position the racket close to the ball and just let the ball touch it (without any hand movement) in a way that the ball stays close to the net with almost no speed and spin, and  touches  the  other  side  of  the  table  more than twice if the opponent doesn't reach it.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:06:40.388725Z"}

The comprehensive rules promulgated in 1924 by the International Lawn Tennis Federation, now known as the International Tennis Federation, have remained largely stable, one of the major changes being the addition of the tie-back system. The Davis Cup, an annual competition between men's national teams, dates to 1900. The analogous competition for women's national teams, the Fed Cup, was founded as the Federation Cup in 1963.

Grip\n\nA grip is a way of holding the racquet in order to hit shots during a match. There are three types of grip.\n\n- i.    Forehand:  the  tennis  forehand  is  a  stroke  in which the inner side of the palm of the dominant hand that is holding the racket faces forward. The forehand stroke is made by swinging the racket across one's  body  in  the  direction  of  where  one wants to land the ball.\n- ii.  Backhand:  The  backhand  is  a  tennis  stroke  in which one swings the racquet around one's body with the back of the hand preceding the palm.\n- iii.  The Serve (Service): A serve in tennis is a shot to start a pint. A player will hit the ball with racquet so it will fall into the diagonally opposite service box without being stopped by the net. There are three types of serve -\n- a)  Flat Serve\n- b)  Slice Serve\n- c)  Kick Serve\n- A  game  point  occurs  in  tennis  whenever the  player  who  is  in  the  lead  in  the  game needs only one more point to win the game. The  terminology  is extended  to sets (set point), matches (match point), and even championships (championship point).\n- A break point occurs if the receiver, not the sever,  has  a  chance  to  win  the  game  with the next point. Break points are of particular importance because serving is generally considered advantageous, with the server being expected to win games in which they are serving.\n- A receiver who has one (score of 30-40), two (score  of  15-40)  or  three  (score  of  love-40) consecutive  chances  to  win  the  game  has break point, double break point or triple break point, respectively.\n- If the leading player wins that game, the player wins  the  set  7-5.  If  the  trailing  player  wins the game, a tie-break is played. A tie-break, played under a separate set of rules, allows one player to win one more game and thus the set, to give a final set score of 7-6.\n- In tournament play, the chair umpire announces  the  winner  of  the  set  and  the overall score.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:06:40.388725Z"}

In India, the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) at Kolkata introduced basketball for the  first  time.  Later  the  YMCA  established  at  Madras in  1920 played an important role in the development of this game. Today basketball is one of the most favourite games in many schools and colleges. The game is played by both men and women of all ages and ability. In order to promote Basketball at National and International levels the Basketball Federation of India was set up in 1950. The first National Basketball tournament was held in Delhi in 1934 and thereafter it was organised every two years until 1951. After that it started being organised annually.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:07:26.561556Z"}

Zones are named or designated by their player alignments.\n- Combined Defence: A third type of defence that can be deployed  is  the  combination  defence.  With  combination defences, some of the players are assigned to play man-to-man while the rest of the defenders play zone.

There  are  two  categories  of  rebounds:  offensive rebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and defensive rebounds, in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball.

Cricket became a generally adopted sport in the second half of the seventeenth century. The  Hambeldon  club  which  was  founded  in  about  1750's had played a significant part in the evolution of the game. It was superseded by the Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C) with  its  headquarters  at  Lords,  London.  Cricket  became an  international  game  with  the  formation  of  the  Imperial Cricket  Conference  (I.C.C)  in  1909.  The  name  of  Imperial Cricket  Conference  was  changed  to  International  Cricket Conference (later, Council) to enable countries outside the common wealth to become its members. The first Limited Over  International  cricket  match  was  played  in  1971  at Melbourne. The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) saw  its  potential  and  staged  the  first  limited  over  Cricket World Cup in 1975. The first edition of limited over Cricket world cup won by West Indies.\n\nIn the 21st century, a new limited over form, Twenty 20, has made an immediate impact. The first T-20 international match took place on August 5 2004, between the women's teams of England and New Zealand. The first T-20 international  match  between  men's  teams  was  played  on February 17 2005, between Australia and New Zealand. The first  T-20  World  Cup  was  played  in  South  Africa  in  2007. India won the first edition of T-20 World Cup.\n\nAn all India team went on a tour of England in 1911 under Maharaja  Bhupinder  Singh  of  Patiala.  The  Indian  Cricket Control Board came into being towards the end of 1928. The national  championship for the Ranji Trophy began in 1935. India entered the international arena and played its first official Test against England in 1932. Meanwhile Prince Ranjit Singhji of  Nawanagar who had gone to England for further studies, made a remarkable name for himself in the game of cricket.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:07:26.561556Z"}

It  does  not  matter whether the ball has touched the  batsman's  bat,  gloves,  body  or  any  other  part  of the batsman. However, the ball is not allowed to have touched  another  player  or  umpire  before  hitting  the wickets.\n- Caught Cricket rules state that if a batsman while playing the ball, either it touches his bat, hand or glove holding the bat then the batsman can be caught out. This is  done  by  the  fielders,  wicket  keeper  or  bowler catching the ball on the full (before it bounces). If this is done then cricket rules state the batsman is out.\n- Leg before Wicket (LBW) If  the  ball  is  bowled and hits the .batsman first without touching the bat, then an LBW decision is possible.

The first ever football club in India, the 'Calcutta Football Club' was founded in 1872. The first football association, 'the Indian Football Association' (IFA) was established in Calcutta in 1893, though there was no Indian on its board till 1930s. It was later, replaced by All India Football Federation (AIFF). The Durand Cup Tournament is the oldest in India and the one of the oldest in the world, was started in Shimla in 1888. The decade of 1951 to 1962 is known as the golden era in the history of Indian football, as the country put up commendable performances in a number of international competitions.

It is a simple and inexpensive game and does not require a big playing area or any equipment. This game is popular in the villages and small towns in India. It is played throughout Asia with minor modifications. Kabaddi is quite new to the other parts of the world. It was known by various names in different parts of India. For example, Chedugudu or Gudugudu in Southern parts of India, Ha-du-du (Men), Chu-kitkit  (Women) in Eastern India, Hu-tu-tu in Maharashtra in western India and Kabaddi in Northern India. It is a game of attack and defense. The two teams occupy opposite halves of a field and take turn in sending a 'Raider' into the other half. In order to win points, members of the opposite team are tagged and the raider tries to return to half, holding the breath and chanting, 'Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi'.\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp107/jehp107_artifacts/image_000001_a251dac0e507c8cab0ed336c425af8af4f574c7e0f8a3e10c69b6d46dc7a412c.png)\n\nFig. 7.1: Children playing kabaddi\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp107/jehp107_artifacts/image_000002_e7497aea905670de0cb83818e44be4ea3e88d801121db1b37c06d0676ae6c6fe.png)","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:07:58.385477Z"}

There  is  also  another  school  of  thought,  in  India, which believes that this game is a version of Chakravyuha, used in Mahabharata. The game was demonstrated for the first  time  at  the  international  level  during  1936  in  Berlin Olympics by Hanuman Vyayam Pracharak Mandal , Amravati, Maharashtra. The game was introduced in the Indian Olympic Games at Calcutta in 1938.\n\nIn  1950,  the  All  India  Kabaddi  Federation  came  into existence and compiled standard rules. The Amateur Kabaddi Federation  of  India  (AKFI)  was  founded  in  1973.  After formation of the AKFI, the first men's nationals were held in Madras (Chennai), while the women's were held in Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1955. The Asian Kabaddi Federation (AKF) was founded  in  1978.  AKF  is  affiliated  to  Olympic  Council  of Asia.  The  parent  body  designated  to  regulate  the  game  at the  international  level  is  International  Kabaddi  Federation (IKF). The Kabaddi World Cup was first played in 2004, then in 2007 and 2010. So far India is the unbeaten champion in  Kabaddi  World  Cup.  Iran  is  the  next  most  successful nation being runners-up twice.

Traditionally the game is played outdoors and the entire court is dug at least 1 foot deep. The mud is removed and filled with sand from the river or beach. This ensures that the player is not seriously  injured  if  he  falls  or  is  dragged  by  opponents. However, now synthetic Kabaddi fields are used for comfort and to reduce injuries. Tournaments like the Indian Kabaddi league have emerged as crowd pullers in urban areas.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:07:58.385477Z"}

The skills used by the antis are called defensive skills. During a raid, the raider has to make maximum use of his limbs to come in contact or touch the opponents in order to score points. This is accomplished through leg touches, such as, toe touch, foot touch, squat leg, thrust, kicks, etc., with lower limbs and through hand touches with upper limbs.\n\nOffensive skills\n\n- a)  Touch:  Touch  is  a  fundamental  and  the  easiest skill,  which  every  raider  applies  in  one  or  the other forms. There are different kinds of touches such as -\n2. (i)  Hand touch: (a) running hand touch (b) stooping hand touch (c) turning hand-touch (d) hopping hand touch (e) fake and touch\n3.

During  the  course  of  a  raid,  the raider will move in different angles, according to the positions and moves of the opponents. At the same time, in order to apply this skill, the raider requires to extend his leg towards the opponent suddenly.\n- (iii)  Foot  touch:  The  modern  toe  touch  is  a moderate  form  of  foot-touch.  The  major difference  between  these  two  skills  is  that in foot-touch, the raider tries to touch the opponents with complete foot whereas in toe touch, toe is used to touch the opponents. This  skill  helps  the  raider  to  cover  more area  in  the  opponent's  court  and  has  an advantage over toe touch.\n- b)  Mule kick: It is very useful in critical situations. Mule kick is a thrust or blow in the air, by the raider, with leg, to touch an anti. There are various types of kicks, such as -\n- i.  Back kick: Kicking the anti who comes behind the raider during the course of raid is known as back kick. The different forms of back kick are:  (i)  running  back  kick  (ii)  standing  back kick (iii) fake and kick (iv) taking a turn and back kick.\n- ii. Side kick: Raiders who raid from second to second and attack the central zone will find this skill the most suitable. The method and principle of kick are the same as in the case of  back  kick.  The  only  difference  between the  two  is  that  the  area  to  be  covered  is sideward.\n- iii.  Curve kick is also called a mule kick as the leg lifted to kick at the anties takes a curve from back to the side. This type of kick will enable the raider to cover more area with the attacking leg. At the same time it enables the raider to change his direction.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:07:58.385477Z"}

It  was created by Professor Jigoro Kano and he believed that the techniques could be practiced as a competitive sport if the more dangerous techniques were omitted. By 1910 Judo was a  recognised  sport  that  could  be  safely  engaged  in  and  in 1911 it was adopted as a part of Japan's educational system. In  the  same  year,  the  Kodokan  Judo  Instructors'  Training Department,  Kodokan  Black  Belt  Association  and  Japan Athletic Association were formed. World War II saw a different development of Judo. Instead of being used for sport,  Judo  was being taught as a combat skill. Those selected for commando and special services training often achieved a high standard of expertise. When Japan hosted the 1964 Olympics, Judo was given its first opportunity as an event. Of the 16 medals awarded for Judo, Japan won three gold medals, and one silver medal. Judo was no longer a Japanese sport but had developed to become an international sport.\n\nThere have been two main developments in Judo over the years.  The  first  was  the  introduction  of  weight  categories. Earlier everyone fought everyone else, with the result that, if two players were equally matched in skill, the bigger man usually  won.  Initially  there  were  three  categories,  and  later this was made into five. Inclusion of the sport in the Olympic Games  in  1964  helped  to  hasten  this  important  reform. There are different styles of Judo. With its inclusion in the Olympics,  there  has  been  a  shift  towards  a  contest  style practice.  In  clubs  where  this  style  is  taught,  the  practice becomes largely a continuous contest. Other schools stress on  skills.  They  favour  repetitive  movements  to  make  them instinctive  and  the  development  of  speed  through  practice with little resistance.\n\nJudo  is  a  popular  martial  art,  combative  and Olympic  sport.  In  the  term  judo,  'ju'  means 'gentle' and 'do' means 'the way or path'. Judo  was  developed  in  Japan  in  the  late  19th century  by  using  the  principles  of  balance  and leverage adapted from jujutsu. Its most prominent feature  is  its  competitive  element,  where  the objective  is  to  either  throw  or  putdown  one's opponent to the ground, immobilise or otherwise subdue one's opponent with a grappling maneuver, or force an opponent to submit by joint locking or by executing a stranglehold or choke. Strikes and thrusts by hands and feet as well as self-defense are a part of judo. Many are trained in Judo either for participation in competition or self-defense.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:07:58.385477Z"}

In India also it received regular patronage from the Emperors and Kings. Wrestling in India then was popularly known as Malla Yuddha .  In  famous  Indian  epic,  Mahabharata, Bhima was considered  to  be  a  great  wrestler  of  that  time and some of the other great wrestlers included Jarasandha, Duryodhana,  and  Karna.  Another  Indian  epic, Ramayana also  mentions  about  wrestling  and  Hanuman  is  described as one of the great wrestlers of that time. Wrestling in India continued to increase its popularity during modern days. Even during the British rule, wrestling in India got encouraging support,  as  the  British  rulers  included  the  game  into  the military  practice.  In  fact,  India  was  considered  among  the top 10 countries in wrestling till the 1960s. India also hosted the  World  Wrestling  Championship  at  New  Delhi  in  1967.\n\nThe term Kushti , which means wrestling, denotes both a local form of the art as well as a more global combat. Kushti is composed of three primary dimensions: dao , pench ,  and paintra (moves,  counter-moves,  and  stance).  There  may be  similarities  between  the daos known  as multani , dhobi pat ,  and kalajangh and  the  corresponding  freestyle  moves known as arm drag, front hip throw, and fireman carry. But what  is  significantly  different  about  wrestling  in  India  is that wrestlers mostly wrestle in mud pits, engage in bouts that last for half an hour or more. At other times and under other circumstances Indian wrestlers follow clearly defined international guidelines, rules, and regulations.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:07:58.385477Z"}

This is worth one point, but can be worth more if the opponent is brought down onto his back.\n- Exposure  is  turning  an  opponent's  shoulders  to  the mat. Once the line of the back area breaks a 90-degree angle, points are scored. This can occur both from the feet and on the mat. A wrestler who holds his opponent in  a  danger  position  for  five  seconds  will  receive  one extra point.\n- Reversal is, when the man underneath completely re -verses  his  position  and  comes  to  the  top  position  in control, he has scored a reversal, worth one point.\n- Escape is when an athlete works to come out from the bottom position (after being under dominant control) and gets to their feet, facing the rival. The athlete has then scored an escape, worth one point.\n- Duration of the bout U-15 cadets and veterans - The duration of a bout will be of two periods of 02 minutes with a 30 second break.\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp107/jehp107_artifacts/image_000023_e927ab392bfa995630c80487b021ef10457f2f513d11825a8cc36d7aa31562b3.png)","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:07:58.385477Z"}

This may cause stress in them. There are many occasions when  they  may  get  stressed  or  feel  angry  or  frustrated. It  is  natural  for  adolescents  to  experience  both  positive and negative emotions. It is also necessary to express their feelings and emotions. There are positive and negative ways of  expressing the emotions. It is pointed out that negative emotions  and  their  expression  in  negative  ways  may  be caused by certain stresses experienced by the adolescents.\n\nIn today's life, stress is becoming a major cause of many health-related problems. It is a known fact that chronic stress negatively  affects  health.  Hypertension,  diabetes  mellitus, cardiac  problems,  depression,  anxiety  attacks,  road-rage, etc., have become common now-a-days. The most common emotion faced by all of us during this COVID-19 pandemic is fear. It has also made us panicky and anxious to deal with such issues.  Yoga  can  help  us  in  dealing  with  stress  and mental health issue during this time. In the management of stress, lifestyle  plays  an  important role. A healthy lifestyle reduces stress and promotes one's health.\n\nHere,  it  is  important  to  recognise  that  stress  can  be tackled and definitely decreased. Many times, we may not necessarily be in control of the situations but we can control our over-all response to such situations.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:08:38.795594Z"}

Some situations  are  easy  to  handle;  while  some  are  difficult. As  a  result,  the  body  starts  responding  at  physiological  and psychological levels. At the physiological level, there may be changes in heart rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, secretions of  hormones, etc.  At  the  psychological  level,  there  may  be changes in attention, concentration, memory and alertness and  also  in  the  emotional  state  (like  anger,  fear,  hate, sadness, etc.).\n\nStress  generally  occurs  as  a  result  of  major  events  in life,  such  as,  tough  competitions,  getting  low  scores  in  an examination, recent break-up in friendship, not getting a good job, a fight with others, and so on. There are several  other factors which may cause stress in a person, like, diseases, poor  living  conditions,  poverty,  problems  in  relationship, challenges  of  adolescence,  wrong  habits,  high  aspirations, unrealistic  goals,  death  of  a  close  relative,  discrimination, fast changing life and many others. However, sometimes it may also occur due to minor issues, such as, not getting up early,  not  getting  ready  on  time,  reaching  school  late,  not getting the desired food, arguments with a friend, not getting permission from parents for attending a late night party, and so on.\n\nIntensity  of  stress  varies  from  person  to  person  and generally depends on perception of a particular situation by that person. A situation may be easy to handle for one person, while it may pose a big challenge to another. For example, examination may cause stress in one student, while it may not affect another student.\n\nStress which motivates us to perform better and learn new skills is beneficial. For example, getting admission in a new course, preparing for an examination or getting promotion may cause stress  but  this  stress  is  beneficial  as  it  finally contributes towards growth and development. Stress may be harmful also. When stress is severe and chronic it reduces efficiency of a person. This kind of stress may adversely affect our ability to feel, think and act.\n\nDuring  severe  stress,  people  may  become  restless  and worried. They may not remember the things properly. Even small  things  may  make  them  angry.  You  also  might  have observed that when you are in tension you become restless. You  may  not  be  able  to  focus  on  your  studies  and  small things may cause irritation.\n\nChronic and severe stress reduces our body's ability to  fight  diseases.  It  can  lead  to  various  psychosomatic diseases, such as, peptic ulcer, migraine, diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, etc. It could even result in heart attack, brain stroke and death.

Yoga practices when become a way of life, play an important role in stress management.\n\nYou have learnt about asana , pranayama , kriya , mudra , bandha and  meditation  in  Class  IX.  However,  yoga  is  not limited  to  the  physical  postures,  breathing  techniques  or meditation for a few minutes only. Rather yoga is a way of life also. It propounds several principles and practices, such as, asana, pranayama, kriya, mudra, bandha and meditation which  are  relevant  to  healthy  living.  Yogic  principles  and practices of healthy living can be adopted by all, irrespective of age, gender, profession or place. As a way of life, yoga gives direction  about  food,  eating  habits,  thinking,  recreational means  and  conduct.

Hence the causes of food spoilage, and the ways to improve the food quality need to be understood.\n\nFood quality is the criteria by which a person accepts or rejects any food item. It is crucial at every stage of food handling  from  farm  to  table.  Good  quality  food  brings health and well-being and poor quality can cause illness and rejection of food in the market as well. Quality of food is often judged in terms of microbiological load and alterations in physical parameters and chemical composition of food. Food quality risks include food adulteration. In order to protect the health of the people every government enforces certain laws and regulations. In India it is the responsibility of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to ensure safety and quality food.\n\nFood  Safety  and  Standards  Authority  of  India  (FSSAI) is a  statuary  body  under  Food  Safety  and  Standards  Act  2006. It  now  encompasses previously employed eight acts in the interest of food operators and consumers. It ensures the availability of wholesome food that is safe for consumption. Amendment and up-gradation are done from time to time. FSSAI code is given to each food item which you can see on various food products.\n\nPhysical examination of food is done on the basis of size, shape, color, texture and visual appeal. The food should be free from dirt, cracks or any foreign material; contamination by bacteria, mould, virus, yeast; and infestation by insects, pests, rats, mice, flies and cockroaches which lead to food spoilage and make the food unfit for human consumption. Food quality can seriously be influenced by factors like heat (temperature); air (oxygen, humidity) or moisture content of food, type of food itself and its composition, treatment given  to  food  during  processing,  handling  and  storage. Food  quality  is  favorably  altered  by  techniques  of  food preservation.  It  is  also  possible  to  enhance  nutritional quality of food by fortification.\n\nFig. 9.3: Fortified\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp109/jehp109_artifacts/image_000008_756e06e2d716c52700ef7d580ba0cd601babaeaa0c823d600f596e87f03c9311.png)\n\nFig. 9.4: Agmark of India\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp109/jehp109_artifacts/image_000009_39b8e0b1d530c90dc904816886e1eb6ca7dc92d75b48cb1c52464922d4011fd1.png)","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:08:59.936926Z"}

It works on the principles of reducing the moisture content, preventing the growth of micro organisms causing spoilage and controlling enzymatic activity. The techniques are -\n\n1. Heat  treatment: Application  of    heat  helps  in  preserving food by destroying the harmful microorganisms. For example,  Pasteurisation  of  milk  and  sterilisation  of bottles.\n2. Refrigeration  and  freezing: Low  temperature  limit the  enzymatic  and  microbial  activities  keeping  the food safe for longer duration.\n3. Drying or dehydration: This technique is based on reducing or removing the moisture content of food as microbes cannot grow in the absence of water.\n4. Addition of preservatives: Preservatives are natural or  chemical  ingredients  which  selectively  control the growth of microorganisms and enzymes in food and restrict spoilage. Jams and jellies are preserved by  sugar  and  pickles  by  salt,  spices  and  oil.  Acid medium also restrict the growth of bacteria. Chemical preservatives like sodium benzoate or Potassium Meta bisulphite (KMS) are used in ketchups and squashes. Preservatives  are  used  in  very  small  quantity.  Use above the prescribed limit is harmful and punishable under law.\n5. Preservation by Radiation: Radiations are emissions of intense energy capable of penetrating tissues. When food is exposed to specific form of radiation (gamma rays from Cobalt 60) under controlled conditions it increases their shelf life and is referred as irradiated food. Items like fruits, potatoes, onions, spices, herbs and some ready-to-eat foods can be preserved in this way. But this technique is not suitable for milk and milk products. The safety of irradiated foods is under debate.  Consumers  can  choose  or  avoid  irradiated foods by identifying its symbol on the label.

These  can  be  chemical  or  biological  in  nature.  Chemical pesticides have played a significant role in increasing food production,  but  unnecessary  and  excessive  use  of  these over a long period of time has adversely influenced various forms of life on earth, as well as, the quality of soil, water and environment. These have disrupted the natural balance of the ecosystem.\n\nPesticides  often  leave  their  residues  in  food  which  are passed on to the body. Those at higher risks are  workers handling or producing pesticides as pesticides are toxic in nature. The adverse effects of pesticide residues depend on the type and amount of the pesticide and the route (ingestion or inhalation) and duration of exposure. If pesticide is used in accordance with good agricultural practice, the residual level would be low and consumption of such foods will not be harmful. Symptoms of acute poisoning include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness and numbness. In severe cases, it may lead to difficulties in breathing, blurred vision and convulsion. Pesticides can cause damage to the brain and nervous system, liver, kidneys and are specially harmful to fetus. In India, FSSAI is responsible for setting maximum residue limits (MRLs) for the pesticides.\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp109/jehp109_artifacts/image_000016_b36166f3a82e4e4201f223f7b3dae44a596db838d5d81e7dd04e3c560c4fb1aa.png)\n\n177\n\n- Search any two cases of food adulteration (personal experience, news item, internet, etc.), identify adulterant and its effect on health.\n- Whom can you approach when you see fungus on bread; suspect water in milk or find ice cream sold after the expiry date?\n- Conduct a survey on 10 persons to assess their actions on food safety asking simple questions like whether they check sign of quality standard (FSSAI, Agmark etc.), date of expiry, ingredients, visual condition of product, package, etc., while buying.

These effects show up over a course of time and are usually  caused  by  progressive  damage  to  different  body organs. Some of the health consequences include irregular eating  habits,  sleep  disorders,  poor  hygiene  resulting  in poor health and low immunity. This predisposes substance abuser to diseases and infections.\n\nSubstance abuse in itself is not a cause of HIV/AIDS or STDs but under the influence of drugs, people may engage in  risk-behaviours  that  make  them  more  susceptible  to these infections. Injectable drug users, however, are more prone to HIV in conditions where the users do not sterilise needles and share needles to inject the drug.\n\nSubstance users may even die suddenly from a so-called overdose,  when  one  consumes  more  than  what  the  body can tolerate. Death may also occur from long-term damage to the organs of the body.\n\nThese  substances  are  especially  harmful  if  consumed during  pregnancy.  These  substances  reach  the  foetus through  blood  and  harm  it  by  crippling  its  growth  and development or death.\n\nSubstance  abuse  influences  not  only  the  individual and family but also the community. The persons who get addicted often lose interest in other activities be it school, job or any other responsibility. They are not able to take care  of  their  responsibilities  and  may  become  a  liability for their families and finally the society. Furthermore, it is expensive to buy substances or drugs on a regular basis. Hence, in desperation, addicted individuals may be forced to engage in petty severe crimes.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:09:16.143153Z"}

Our  socio-economic  needs  are such that people depend upon each other as we cannot live in  isolation.  We  live  together  and  collectively  share  certain amenities  that  are  necessary  for  our  day-to-day  existence. In  the  previous  classes  (Class  VII  to  IX),  we  read  about  the negative  effects  of  unhygienic  or  filthy  surroundings  on  our health. Regular access to basic amenities, such as, clean water, sanitation,  garbage  disposal  facilities,  health  care  services, recreational facilities, etc., are important for prevention of  illnesses  and  diseases.  For  prevention  of  diseases  like coronavirus, maintaining of social distance is very important.

The focus will also be on the principles of cooperative living to ensure healthy living conditions for one and all.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:09:32.562310Z"}

It  is  about  75  km  away  from  Shillong, the capital of Meghalaya. Most of the houses in this village are  beautifully  decorated  with  flowers  and  plants.  As  per the  Census  of  2011,  the  total  population  of  Mawlynnong is  414. The main occupation of the villagers is agriculture, but  it  has  also  been  an  age  old  tradition  of  ensuring  that the surrounding environment is clean. In fact cleanliness is a collective effort and this practice is ingrained in the people since their childhood. The people voluntarily sweep the roads and  lanes,  water  the  plants  in  public  areas  and  clean  the drains.  A  dustbin  made  out  of  bamboo  is  found  all  along the  village.  Everyone  makes  it  a  point  that  dirt  and  waste are not thrown anywhere. All the waste from the dustbin is collected and kept in a pit, which the villagers use as manure. Trees are planted to restore and maintain nature's balance. Mawlynnong's fame as the cleanest village in Asia, is drawing a lot of domestic as well as international tourists, as a result of which tourism is also an important source of employment for the local youths. Besides, there are many interesting sights to  see  such  as  the  famous living root bridge in the nearby village of Riwai, which is a fascinating example of indigenous methods of conservation and sustainability. Local youths are available as enthusiastic and informative guides.\n\nFig. 11.1: Mawlynnong Village\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp111/jehp111_artifacts/image_000003_11e7cf62d9b3033b294d89d51fcf87896c11bb5080b9f89d02930734f54d1307.png)","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:09:32.562310Z"}

The healthy community only be develped when its members recognise  their  roles  and  responsibilities.

Healthy community is one in which all residents have access to quality  education,  safe  and  healthy  homes,  adequate employment, transportation, physical activity and nutrition.  Living  in  overcrowded  and  unhygienic  places with  excessive  noise  and  pollution,  may  lead  to  various forms of illnesses, diseases and stress. For instance, lack of  adequate  space,  poor  ventilation  in  rooms  and  toxic fumes in the air, increase the risk of air borne diseases. Access to basic amenities such as regular water supply, safe  drinking  water  and  sanitation,  is  important  for healthy community living. In the previous classes (Classes VII  to  IX),  it  has  been  learnt  that  open  and  unattended garbage  dumps  are  a  potential  breeding  place  for  flies, cockroaches, insects and so on. Stagnant water and open drains breed mosquitoes, the carrier of diseases, such as, malaria, dengue and chikungunya. Water borne diseases, such  as,  cholera,  jaundice,  diarrhea  and  gastroenteritis are also resulted due to water pollution.\n\nAccess to basic amenities also includes other provisions such as electricity, hospitals, dispensaries, housing facilities, roads  and  transportation,  schools,  colleges,  employment, security, recreational facilities and so on.

They are required to  ensure  rules  and  regulations  for  safety  measures,  cleanliness, ensure  equal  access  of  public  amenities  to  all  members, promote adoption of waste management practices, and help ecological restoration and conservation. However, we cannot depend  solely  on  the  government  to  take  the  initiative.  The quality of life in a community also depends on how the members of  the  community  work  to  improve  on  available  resources and ensure that the government provides for these facilities.\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp111/jehp111_artifacts/image_000008_88f7d5eb3bdcdccf31a607d8511469cb1041925ee7a8a00da25d0af78dd2578d.png)\n\nYou might have seen this logo before.

You must  have  also  seen  some  of  the  television advertisements through which the government advertises  the  importance  and  necessity  of staying  clean  and  keeping  our  environment clean. In this Clean India campaign - known popularly  as  the Swachh  Bharat  Abhiyan , the vision of a Clean and hygienic India, once seen by Mahatma Gandhi, can happen only if members  of  every  community  cooperate  and accept individual and collective responsibility of keeping themselves, their homes and their surroundings clean.\n\nIn  order  to  work  collectively,  members  of  a  community need to develop values of co-operation, kindness, respect, gratitude, joy, peace and selflessness. These attributes are important in fostering the principles of collective work and in  nurturing  healthy  social  relationships.  The  example of  Mawlynnong  village  shows  that  high  income  alone is  not  the  only  criterion  for  healthy  living.  Cooperative action, responsibility and positive values can also help in improving the quality of life, and healthy living conditions for one and all.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:09:32.562310Z"}

Camping  is  an  outdoor activity,  where  familiar surroundings are left to spend a night or several nights at an outdoor site. The location of these sites varies as per the objectives of the trip,  time  of  the  year and budget available.\n\nCommon camping sites are: visits to villages or rural areas to  understand  their  pattern  of  living;  mountain  areas, national  parks,  lakes,  beaches,  forests,  etc.  One  can  also plan  camping  activities  in  a  nearby  place,  such  as,  open fields, park, or even in an open space of the school premises.

It  gives  an  opportunity  to learn from nature in a joyful, exciting and adventurous manner. Living in the natural environment with students from different areas, cultures, religions and backgrounds, help then to learn to work as a team in various activities. These activities differ from adventurous and challenging ones, to the most basic ones, such as, cooking, cleaning, collecting water, etc. In this process, students learn the importance of self-reliance, teamwork, co-existence, importance of natural resources and organisational skills. Camping also offers great opportunities for empowerment of the girls.\n\nFig. 11.7: Trekking\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp111/jehp111_artifacts/image_000016_3b8f52a63403e5249227a1423512551638ec8e539bf6bc932bc6a86b65eecc37.png)\n\nFig. 11.8: Mountaineering\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp111/jehp111_artifacts/image_000017_ec2135433a3c914b27837acd6dea1b37294707c0d306bc32cb9588ab96fd603e.png)\n\nWhile  camping,  one  can  engage  in  adventure  sport, such  as,  trekking,  river  rafting,  mountaineering,  rock climbing,  repelling,  paragliding,  caving.  Adventure  sport help to develop courage, self-confidence, leadership qualities and enhance concentration powers. This is also a great form of physical exercise.

It  can  also  complement  much  of  the  textual  data in  your  geography  and  science  textbooks  through  direct experiences. At the same time, learn to appreciate the beauty and simplicity of nature to make all understand how much disconnected from 'Mother Earth one has become.' You realise the importance of nature and how we should take care of it. Moreover, through interaction with local communities, one learns about edible and medicinal plants, local crafts, firstaid and various other sustainable forms of living.\n\nDuring the evenings all may gather around campfires which give  a  great  opportunity  for  social  bonding.  Campfires  also enable to learn about different cultures through story telling, songs, dances, skits and games. On many occasions hidden talents of individuals are brought out during these activities.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:09:32.562310Z"}

Guardians or parents are the prime teachers and caretakers who feed them healthy food and are also their play mates. They have to be aware themselves to be role model and make children appreciate as they grow. The  benefits  of  enjoying  nutritious  food  and  being  aware of  a  balanced  diet  is  of  paramount  importance.  Watching of television for longer duration is bad for students. Parents  themselves  have  to  be  cautious  in  what  they  do in  front  of  children  and  how  long  they  are  in  front  of  the TV.  However,  at  the  same  time  good  TV  programmes  are an  avenue  for  learning.  Encourage  them  to  indulge  in physical activity to build their muscles and bones. Fit body and  fitness  depends  primarily  on  proper  diet  and  healthy body  and  mind.  The  parents  and  elder  family  members need  to  guide  them  in  social  skills.  Parents  and  elders have  to  be  accessible  to  children  for  necessary  guidance. They  form a 'safety network'. They are to guide adolescents through  advice,  answer  their  queries  and  occupy  them through  activities  to  keep  them  away  from  involvement in  addictive  substances  like  tobacco,  drugs  and  alcohol which they might believe are helpful in tiding over stress. However, these substances have deleterious effects on the growing body.\n\n![Image](outputs/jehp112/jehp112_artifacts/image_000008_c74a4d40208306dc7198d6b2553daac459b91fce11b0936b452014518e482245.png)\n\n211","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:09:46.534670Z"}

The  teacher  needs  to  play  an  active  role  in  discouraging her  students  from  engaging  in  socially  unhealthy practices  such  as  vindictive  attitudes,  selfishness, jealousy and culture of hatred. For this, teacher has to sacrifice time and energy. It is however, necessary for a teacher and school authorities to understand that more than finishing the syllabus and passing exams, it is the teacher's responsibility to build good human beings. Home has a large role to play but it  has  been  the  mission  of  teachers  to  contribute towards  grooming  students  into  socially  healthy adults\n2. Another role of a teacher in inculcating 'social health' is to have a friendly, stress-free atmosphere in class. This  can  happen  if  students  are  engaged  in  'group activities', especially activities for 'experiential learning'.  Members  of  groups  are  reshuffled  from time  to  time  for  team  activities  so  that  students may understand that it takes all kinds of people to make the world and the socially healthy groups can live in harmony despite differing in opinions. Group activities build team spirit and remove boredom.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:09:46.534670Z"}

Their health is very important  as  they  constitute  a  large  percentage  of  our  population. Many factors like physical, psychological, socio-economic and cultural influence our health, both in our day-to-day life and in the long run. The  involvement  of  all  children  in  physical  activities,  games  and sport, and yoga along with authentic knowledge is essential for their physical, emotional, social and mental development. In this endeavour, school education plays an important role. All the National Curriculum Frameworks have recommended health and physical education as an integral  part  of  the  school  curriculum.  With  this  view,  the  National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has prepared this textbook on Health and Physical Education for Class X.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:10:13.078785Z"}

The information about coronavirus (COVID-19), its modes of transmision and prevention have also been included at relevant places to help the children remain safe and healthy.

We continue our discussion on real numbers in this chapter. We begin with very important properties of positive integers in Sections 1.2, namely the Euclid's division algorithm and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\n\nEuclid's division algorithm, as the name suggests, has to do with divisibility of integers. Stated simply, it says any positive integer a can be divided by another positive integer b in such a way that it leaves a remainder r that is smaller than b . Many of you probably recognise this as the usual long division process. Although this result is quite easy to state and understand, it has many applications related to the divisibility properties of integers. We touch upon a few of them, and use it mainly to compute the HCF of two positive integers.\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, on the other hand, has to do something with multiplication of positive integers. You already know that every composite number can be expressed as a product of primes in a unique way-this important fact is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Again, while it is a result that is easy to state and understand, it has some very deep and significant applications in the field of mathematics. We use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic for two main applications. First, we use it to prove the irrationality of many of the numbers you studied in Class IX, such as 2, 3  and 5 . Second, we apply this theorem to explore when exactly the decimal expansion of a rational number, say ( 0) p q q  ,  is  terminating and when it is nonterminating repeating. We do so by looking at the prime factorisation of the denominator q of p q .  Y ou will see that the prime factorisation of q will completely reveal the nature of the decimal expansion of p .\n\nq So let us begin our exploration.\n\n![Image](outputs/jemh101/jemh101_artifacts/image_000000_e12ae1c631ea2e26dafba1d672cbb8c96fa50e1ec45c63e5d1ea1076c9d8cae9.png)","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:11:46.146728Z"}

You studied about their existence and how the rationals and the irrationals together made up the real numbers. You even studied how to locate irrationals on the number line. However, we did not prove that they were irrationals. In this section, we will prove that 2 , 3, 5  and, in general, p is irrational, where p is a prime. One of the theorems, we use in our proof, is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\n\nRecall, a number ' s ' is called irrational if it cannot be written in the form , p q where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. Some examples of irrational numbers, with which you are already familiar, are :\n\n$$\\sqrt { 2 } , \\sqrt { 3 } , \\sqrt { 1 5 } , \\pi , - \\frac { \\sqrt { 2 } } { \\sqrt { 3 } } , 0 . 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 \\cdots , e t c .$$\n\nBefore we prove that 2  is irrational, we need the following theorem, whose proof is based on the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\n\nTheorem 1.2 : Let p be a prime number. If p divides a 2 ,  then  p  divides  a,  where a  is  a  positive  integer.\n\n*Proof : Let the prime factorisation of a be as follows :\n\n$$a = p _ { \\nu } p _ { 2 } \\dots p _ { n } , \\text { where } p _ { 1 } , p _ { 2 } , \\dots , p _ { n } \\text { are primes, not necessarily distinct} .$$\n\n$$T h e r e f o r \\, ; \\, a ^ { 2 } = ( p _ { 1 } p _ { 2 } \\dots p _ { n } ) ( p _ { 1 } p _ { 2 } \\dots p _ { n } ) = p _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } p _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } \\dots p _ { n } ^ { 2 } .$$\n\nNow, we are given that p divides a 2 . Therefore, from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, it follows that p is  one of the prime factors of a 2 .  However, using the uniqueness part of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, we realise that the only prime factors of a 2 are p , p , . . ., p . So p is one of p , p , . . ., p .\n\n$$N o w , \\sin c e \\, a = p _ { 1 } p _ { 2 } \\dots p _ { n } , p \\text { divides } a .$$\n\n1 2 n 1 2 n .\n\nWe are now ready to give a proof that 2  is irrational.\n\nThe proof is based on a technique called 'proof by contradiction'. (This technique is discussed in some detail in Appendix 1).\n\nTheorem 1.3 : 2 is  irrational.\n\nProof : Let us assume, to the contrary, that 2  is rational.\n\n* Not from the examination point of view.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T09:11:46.146728Z"}

Recall that if p ( x ) is a polynomial in x , the highest power of x in p ( x ) is called the degree of the  polynomial p ( x ).  For  example,  4 x +  2  is  a  polynomial  in  the  variable x of degree 1, 2 y 2 - 3 y + 4 is a polynomial in the variable y of degree 2, 5 x 3 - 4 x 2 + x -2\n\nis a polynomial in the variable x of degree 3 and 7 u 6 -4 2 3 4 8 2 u u u    is a polynomial in the variable u of degree 6. Expressions like 1 1 x  , 2 x  , 2 1 2 3 x x   etc., are not polynomials.\n\nA polynomial of degree 1 is called a linear polynomial . For example, 2 x - 3, 3 5, x  2 y  , 2 11 x  ,  3 z + 4, 2 1 3 u  , etc.,  are all linear polynomials. Polynomials such as 2 x + 5 x 2 , x 3 + 1, etc., are not linear polynomials.\n\nA polynomial of degree 2 is called a quadratic polynomial . The name 'quadratic' has been derived from the word 'quadrate', which means 'square'. 2 2 , 2 3 5 x x  \n\n$$y ^ { 2 } - 2 , \\, ^ { u } 2 - x ^ { 2 } + \\sqrt { 3 } x , \\, \\frac { u } { 3 } - 2 u ^ { 2 } + 5 , \\sqrt { 5 } v ^ { 2 } - \\frac { 2 } { 3 } v , 4 z ^ { 2 } + \\frac { 1 } { 7 } \\text { are some examples of }$$\n\nquadratic polynomials (whose coefficients are real numbers). More generally, any quadratic polynomial in x is of the form ax 2 + bx + c , where a , b , c are real numbers and a  0. A polynomial of degree 3 is called a cubic polynomial .

In fact, the most general form of a cubic polynomial is\n\n$$a x ^ { 3 } + b x ^ { 2 } + c x + d ,$$\n\nwhere, a , b , c , d are real numbers and a  0.\n\nNow consider the polynomial p ( x )  = x 2 -  3 x -  4.  Then,  putting x =  2  in  the polynomial, we get p (2) = 2 2 - 3 × 2 - 4 = - 6. The value '- 6', obtained by replacing x by 2 in x 2 - 3 x - 4, is the value of x 2 - 3 x - 4 at x = 2. Similarly, p (0) is the value of p ( x ) at x = 0, which is - 4.\n\nIf p ( x ) is a polynomial in x , and if k is any real number, then the value obtained by replacing x by k in p ( x ), is called the value of p ( x ) at x = k , and is denoted by p ( k ).\n\nWhat is the value of p ( x ) = x 2  -3 x - 4 at x = -1? We have :\n\n$$p ( - 1 ) = ( - 1 ) ^ { 2 } - \\{ 3 \\times ( - 1 ) \\} - 4 = 0$$\n\nAlso, note that p (4) = 4 2 - (3  4) - 4 = 0.\n\nAs p (-1)  =  0  and p (4)  =  0,  -1  and  4  are  called  the  zeroes  of  the  quadratic polynomial x 2 -  3 x -  4.  More generally, a real number k is  said to be a zero of a polynomial p ( x ) , if p ( k ) = 0.\n\nYou have already studied in Class IX, how to find the zeroes of a linear polynomial. For example, if k is a zero of p ( x ) = 2 x + 3, then p ( k ) = 0 gives us\n\n$$2 k + 3 = 0 , i . e . , k = - \\frac { 3 } { 2 } \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot$$\n\n$$2 k + 3 = 0 , 1 . e . , \\kappa - 2 \\left ( 2 \\right ) \\\\ \\text {In general, if } k \\text { is a zero of } p ( x ) \\equiv a x + b , \\text { then } p ( k ) = a k + b = 0 , \\text { i.e., } k = \\frac { - b } { a } \\cdot \\\\$$\n\nSo, the zero of the linear polynomial ax + b is (Constant term) Coefficient of b a x    .\n\nThus, the zero of a linear polynomial is related to its coefficients. Does this happen in the case of other polynomials too? For example, are the zeroes of a quadratic polynomial also related to its coefficients?\n\nIn this chapter, we will try to answer these questions. We will also study the division algorithm for polynomials.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T16:34:58.863032Z"}

She wanted to enjoy rides on the Giant Wheel and play Hoopla (a game in which you throw a ring on the items kept in a stall, and if the ring covers any object completely, you get it). The number of times she played Hoopla is half the number of rides she had on the Giant Wheel. If each ride costs ` 3, and a game of Hoopla costs ` 4, how would you find out the number of rides she had and how many times she played Hoopla, provided she spent ` 20.\n\nMay be you will try it by considering different cases. If she has one ride, is it possible? Is it possible to have two rides? And so on.

A pair of linear equations in two variables, which has a solution, is called a consistent pair of linear equations.  A pair of linear equations which are equivalent has infinitely many distinct common solutions. Such a pair is called a dependent pair of linear equations in two variables. Note that a dependent pair of linear equations is always consistent.\n\nWe can now summarise the behaviour of lines representing a pair of linear equations in two variables and the existence of solutions as follows:\n\n- (i) the lines may intersect in a single point. In this case, the pair of equations has a unique solution (consistent pair of equations).\n- (ii) the  lines  may  be  parallel.  In  this  case,  the  equations  have  no  solution (inconsistent pair of equations).\n- (iii) the lines may be coincident. In this case, the equations have infinitely many solutions [dependent (consistent) pair of equations].\n\nConsider the following three pairs of equations.\n\n- (i) x - 2 y = 0 and 3 x + 4 y - 20 = 0 (The lines intersect)\n- (ii) 2 x + 3 y - 9 = 0 and 4 x + 6 y - 18 = 0 (The lines coincide)\n- (iii) x + 2 y - 4 = 0 and 2 x + 4 y - 12 = 0 (The lines are parallel)\n\nLet us now write down, and compare, the values of 1 1 1 2 2 2 , and a b c c a b in all the three  examples.

This is sometimes more convenient than the substitution method. Let us see how this method works.\n\nExample 8 : The ratio of incomes of two persons is 9 : 7 and the ratio of their expenditures is 4 : 3. If each of them manages to save ` 2000 per month, find their monthly incomes.\n\nSolution : Let us denote the incomes of the two person by ` 9 x and ` 7 x and their expenditures by ` 4 y and ` 3 y respectively. Then the equations formed in the situation is given by :\n\n$$9 x - 4 y = 2 0 0 0$$\n\n$$7 x - 3 y = 2 0 0 0$$\n\nStep 1 : Multiply Equation (1) by 3 and Equation (2) by 4 to make the coefficients of y equal. Then we get the equations:\n\n$$2 7 x - 1 2 y = 6 0 0 0$$\n\n$$2 8 x - 1 2 y = 8 0 0 0 \\times 1 2$$\n\nStep 2 : Subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4) to eliminate y , because the coefficients of y are the same. So, we get\n\n$$( 2 8 x - 2 7 x ) - ( 1 2 y - 1 2 y ) = 8 0 0 0 - 6 0 0 0$$\n\n$$x = 2 0 0 0$$\n\ni.e.,\n\nStep 3 : Substituting this value of x in (1), we get\n\n$$9 ( 2 0 0 0 ) - 4 y =$$\n\n$$y = 2 0 0 0$$\n\n$$i . e ,$$\n\nSo, the solution of the equations is x = 2000, y = 4000. Therefore, the monthly incomes of the persons are ` 18,000 and ` 14,000, respectively.\n\nVerification  : 18000 :  14000  =  9  :  7.

One type was the quadratic polynomial of the form ax 2 + bx + c , a  0. When we equate this polynomial to zero, we get a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations come up when we deal with many real-life situations. For instance, suppose a charity trust decides to build a prayer hall having a carpet area of 300 square metres with its length one metre more than twice its breadth. What should be the length and breadth of the hall? Suppose the breadth of the hall is x metres. Then, its length should be (2 x + 1) metres. We can depict this information pictorially as shown in Fig. 4.1.\n\n![Image](outputs/jemh104/jemh104_artifacts/image_000001_2ceb0ec6e1850fc97ab0b970a741b91534b16da3696c6553298925ac8b8fedec.png)\n\n$$\\text {Now,} & \\quad \\text {area of the half} = ( 2 x + 1 ) . \\, x \\, m ^ { 2 } = ( 2 x ^ { 2 } + x ) \\, m ^ { 2 } \\\\ \\text {So,} & \\quad \\\\ \\text {Therefore,} & \\quad 2 x ^ { 2 } + x - 3 0 0 = 0$$\n\nSo, the breadth of the hall should satisfy the equation 2 x 2 + x - 300 = 0 which is a quadratic equation.\n\nMany people believe that Babylonians were the first to solve quadratic equations. For instance, they knew how to find two positive numbers with a given positive sum and a given positive product, and this problem is equivalent to solving a quadratic equation of the form x 2 -px + q =  0.  Greek  mathematician  Euclid  developed  a geometrical approach for finding out lengths which, in our present day terminology, are solutions of quadratic equations. Solving of quadratic equations, in general form, is often credited to ancient Indian mathematicians.

Similarly, 2 x 2  - 3 x + 1 = 0, 4 x - 3 x 2  + 2 = 0 and 1 x 2  + 300 = 0 are also quadratic equations.\n\nIn fact, any equation of the form p ( x ) = 0, where p ( x ) is a polynomial of degree 2, is a quadratic equation. But when we write the terms of p ( x ) in descending order of their degrees, then we get the standard form of the equation. That is, ax 2 + bx + c = 0, a  0 is called the standard form of a quadratic equation .\n\nQuadratic equations arise in several situations in the world around us and in different fields of mathematics.

If  we  replace x by  1  on  the LHS of this equation, we get (2 × 1 2 ) - (3 × 1) + 1 = 0 = RHS of the equation. We say that 1 is a root of the quadratic equation 2 x 2 - 3 x + 1 = 0. This also means that 1 is a zero of the quadratic polynomial 2 x 2 - 3 x + 1.\n\nIn  general,  a  real  number  is  called  a  root  of  the  quadratic  equation ax 2 + bx + c = 0, a  0 if a  2 + b  + c = 0. We also say that x =  is a solution of the quadratic equation , or that  satisfies the quadratic equation . Note that the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial ax 2 + bx + c and the roots of the quadratic equation ax 2 + bx + c = 0 are the same .\n\nYou have observed, in Chapter 2, that a quadratic polynomial can have at most two zeroes. So, any quadratic equation can have atmost two roots.\n\nYou have learnt in Class IX, how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting their middle terms. We shall use this knowledge for finding the roots of a quadratic equation. Let us see how.\n\nExample 3 : Find the roots of the equation 2 x 2 - 5 x + 3 = 0, by factorisation.\n\nSolution : Let us first split the middle term - 5 x as -2 x -3 x [because (-2 x ) × (-3 x ) = 6 x 2 = (2 x 2 ) × 3].\n\n$$S o , \\quad 2 x ^ { 2 } - 5 x + 3 = 2 x ^ { 2 } - 2 x - 3 x + 3 = - 2 x \\left ( x - 1 \\right ) - 3 ( x - 1 ) = ( 2 x - 3 ) ( x - 1 )$$\n\n$$N o w , 2 x ^ { 2 } - 5 x + 3 = 0 \\, \\text { can be rewritten as } ( 2 x - 3 ) ( x - 1 ) = 0 .$$\n\nSo, the values of x for which 2 x 2 - 5 x + 3 = 0 are the same for which (2 x - 3)( x - 1) = 0, i.e., either 2 x - 3 = 0 or x - 1 = 0.\n\n$$N o w , 2 x - 3 = 0 \\text { gives } x = \\frac { 3 } { 2 } \\text { and } x - 1 = 0 \\text { gives } x = 1 .$$\n\nIn other words, 1 and 3 2 are the roots of the equation 2 x 2 - 5 x + 3 = 0.\n\nSo, 3 2 x  and x = 1 are the solutions of the equation.\n\nVerify that these are the roots of the given equation.","table_csv_path":null,"table_image_path":null,"image_path":null,"caption":null,"bounding_box":null,"language":"en","source_type":"docling","extraction_timestamp":"2025-10-17T16:42:52.592497Z"}

A quadratic equation in the variable x is of the form ax 2 + bx + c = 0, where a , b , c are real numbers and a  0.\n2. A real number  is  said  to  be a root of the quadratic equation ax 2 + bx + c =  0,  if a  2 + b  + c = 0. The zeroes of the quadratic polynomial ax 2 + bx + c and the roots of the quadratic equation ax 2 + bx + c = 0 are the same.\n3. If we can factorise ax 2 + bx + c , a  0, into a product of two linear factors, then the roots of the quadratic equation ax 2 + bx + c = 0 can be found by equating each factor to zero.\n4. Quadratic formula: The roots of a quadratic equation ax 2 + bx + c = 0 are given by\n\n$$\\frac { - b \\pm \\sqrt { b ^ { 2 } - 4 a c } } { 2 a } , \\text { provided } b ^ { 2 } - 4 a c \\geq 0 .$$\n\n5.
