A team game means organised physical activity with players working together towards a shared objective. In team games a group of individuals in the same team, work together to achieve the objective of being the winners of the game. Team members set points and scores, make decisions, communicate among themselves, manage conflicting situations, and solve problems in a supportive, trusting atmosphere in order to achieve their objectives. Team games include games, such as, Basketball, Cricket, Football, Handball, Hockey, Kabaddi, Kho-Kho and Volleyball, etc. In this chapter, we shall discuss Basketball, Cricket, Football, Hockey and Volleyball.

five players on each team. They play on a marked rectangular court with a basket fixed on each end. Basketball is one of the world's most popular games.

The  rules  allow  all  players  to  move  freely  around  the court  and  occupy  any  position.  All  players  have  an  equal opportunity to score a Basket. To play basketball, students should  learn  and  practice  the  basic  skills  of  dribbling, passing, receiving and shooting.

## History

The  game  of  basketball  originated  at  the  Springfield College  of  Physical  Education,  Massachusetts,  USA  in 1891, invented by Dr. James Naismith. In 1894, Naismith fixed  the  first  13  rules  which  still  form  the  basis  of modern basketball. In India, the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) at Kolkata introduced basketball for the  first  time.  Later  the  YMCA  established  at  Madras in  1920 played an important role in the development of this game. Today basketball is one of the most favourite games in many schools and colleges. The game is played by both men and women of all ages and ability. In order to promote Basketball at National and International levels the Basketball Federation of India was set up in 1950. The first National Basketball tournament was held in Delhi in 1934 and thereafter it was organised every two years until 1951. After that it started being organised annually.

Basketball is played on a rectangular court, which should be an indoor wooden court or an outdoor concrete court having two side lines and two end lines. The dimensions of basketball court is 28 x15 meters. The court is divided

# PAGE 3

into two sections, called half-courts, by the mid-court line, which is where the game starts with a jump ball. A jump ball is when a referee throws the ball up at center circle to determine which team gets possession. Two players from opposing teams jump up to tap the ball out of the circle in order to gain control over the ball take the game forward. The basketball posts are located at the opposite ends of the court.

Players who are fouled either get ball possession or are awarded one or two free throws and one point is awarded for successfully converting a free throw, which is attempted from a line 15 feet (4.6 m) from the basket. Each player is allowed 5 personal fouls before they are disqualified from the game. At this point they no longer remain a part of the game.

- Two  points  are  awarded  when  a  basket  is  scored during the game but three points are awarded when a basket is scored from outside the 6.25 mtrs line.

## Fundamental skills

We are well aware that, to play any game one has to learn some  skills.  Similarly  to  play  basketball  game  a  player should learn the following fundamental skills.

## Dribbling

It is important to penetrate to score a basket, move the ball across the court, get away from the defenders, and find  a  good  passing  lane.  There  are  different  types  of dribbling -

- basic dribble
- low dribbling
- high dribble
- behind the back
- crossover dribble
- change-of-pace
- between the legs dribble

## Passing

A  good  offensive  attack  requires  accurate  passing  from players. It helps find an open man, to find a good shooter or to get away from a defender. There are several types of passes used in basketball, either one hand or both hand pass -

- Off-the-dribble

The objective of the game is to win by scoring maximum points. Therefore, improving the team's shooting is important to win a game. Shooting with either one hand or both hands is done in the following ways -

- Jump shot
- Dunk shot
- Free throw
- Layup
- Three-point shot
- Hook shot

## Defence

The  game  of  basketball  allows  a  variety  of  defences  to  be deployed  in  an  effort  to  disrupt  and  combat  offensive plays.  Here  are  examples  of  the  three  basic  categories  of team defences. In addition, each category comprises of an assortment of different variations.

- Man  to  man  defence: Man-to-man  defences  match up  the  defenders  against  specific  offensive  players. Defenders are usually assigned to be matched up with offensive players by size and ability.
- Zone Defence: In Zone defence, defenders are assigned to guard specific areas on the court. Zones are named or designated by their player alignments.
- Combined Defence: A third type of defence that can be deployed  is  the  combination  defence.  With  combination defences, some of the players are assigned to play man-to-man while the rest of the defenders play zone. Combination defences are usually deployed in an effort to stop or neutralise great individual offensive players.

## Rebounding

The objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field point or free throw, as it rebounds from the ring or backboard. This plays a major role in the game, as most possessions end when a team misses a  shot.  There  are  two  categories  of  rebounds:  offensive rebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and defensive rebounds, in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball.  The  majority  of  rebounds  are  defensive,  as  the  team on defence tends to be in better position to recover missed shots.

## CriCket

## Introduction

Cricket  is  a  bat  and  ball  game  played  between  two  teams on a field, at the centre of which is a rectangular pitch. One team bats, trying to defend the wicket and scoring as many runs as possible. The other team bowls and fields, trying to dismiss the batsmen and thus limiting the runs scored by the batting team. A run is scored by the striking batsman hitting  the  ball  with  his  bat,  running  to  the  opposite  end of  the  pitch  and  touching  the  crease  there  without  being dismissed. The teams switch between batting and fielding at the end of an inning.

## History

The game of cricket, as it is played today, has its origin in the south eastern part of England. Cricket became a generally adopted sport in the second half of the seventeenth century. The  Hambeldon  club  which  was  founded  in  about  1750's had played a significant part in the evolution of the game. It was superseded by the Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C) with  its  headquarters  at  Lords,  London.  Cricket  became an  international  game  with  the  formation  of  the  Imperial Cricket  Conference  (I.C.C)  in  1909.  The  name  of  Imperial Cricket  Conference  was  changed  to  International  Cricket Conference (later, Council) to enable countries outside the common wealth to become its members. The first Limited Over  International  cricket  match  was  played  in  1971  at Melbourne. The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) saw  its  potential  and  staged  the  first  limited  over  Cricket World Cup in 1975. The first edition of limited over Cricket world cup won by West Indies.

In the 21st century, a new limited over form, Twenty 20, has made an immediate impact. The first T-20 international match took place on August 5 2004, between the women's teams of England and New Zealand. The first T-20 international  match  between  men's  teams  was  played  on February 17 2005, between Australia and New Zealand. The first  T-20  World  Cup  was  played  in  South  Africa  in  2007. India won the first edition of T-20 World Cup.

An all India team went on a tour of England in 1911 under Maharaja  Bhupinder  Singh  of  Patiala.  The  Indian  Cricket Control Board came into being towards the end of 1928. The national  championship for the Ranji Trophy began in 1935. India entered the international arena and played its first official Test against England in 1932. Meanwhile Prince Ranjit Singhji of  Nawanagar who had gone to England for further studies, made a remarkable name for himself in the game of cricket.

## Ways to score runs

The aim of the batsmen is to score runs. One of the main cricket rules for batsmen to score runs is that they must run to the pitch at each other's end (from one end to the other), hence score one run. Cricket rules state that, they may run multiple runs per shot. As well as while running they can also score runs by hitting boundaries. A batsman hits a boundary and scores 4 or 6 runs. A four and six both are  scored  by  hitting  the  ball.  If  it  crosses  the  boundary after  touching  the  ground  it  is  considered  as  four  and  if the ball crosses boundary before touching the ground it is considered as six. Cricket rules also state that once a 4 or 6 has been scored any runs physically scored by the batsman by running between the wickets are null and void.

Other ways runs can be scored according to the cricket rules include no balls, wide balls, byes and leg byes. Cricket rules state that all runs scored by these methods are awarded to the batting team but not the individual batters.

- A No Ball can  be  declared  for  many  reasons:  If  the heel of the bowler's front foot lands on or in front of the popping crease or if the bowler's back foot touches then outside the return crease the ball is declared no ball. If the bowler bowls the ball from the wrong place, the ball is declared dangerous (often happens when bowled at the batsmen's body on the full), bounces more than twice or rolls before reaching the batsman or  if  fielders  are  standing  in  illegal  positions.  The batsman can hit a No ball and score runs off it but cannot be out from a No ball except if they are run out, hit the ball twice, handle the ball or obstruct the field. The batsman gains any runs scored off the no ball for his shot while the team also gains one run for the no ball itself.
- A Wide Ball will be declared if the umpire thinks the batsman  did  not  have  a  reasonable  opportunity  to score off the delivery. However if the delivery is bowled over the batsmen's head it will not be declared a wide but  a  no  ball.  Umpires  are  much  stricter  on  wide deliveries in the shorter format of the game while being much more relaxed in test cricket. A wide delivery will add one run to the batting team and any runs scored by the batsman. The batsman is not supposed to be declared  'out'  off  a  wide  delivery  except  if  they  are stumped, run out, handle the ball, hit their wicket or obstruct the field.
- A Bye is where a ball that isn't a no ball or wide passes the striking batsman and runs are scored without the batsman hitting the ball.

- A Leg  Bye is  where  runs  are  scored  by  hitting  the batsman, but not the bat and the ball is not a no ball or wide. However no runs can be scored if the striking batsman  didn't  attempt  to  play  a  shot  or  if  he  was avoiding the ball.

## Types of 'out' in cricket

Ways batsmen can be given 'Out' according to cricket rules: There are a number of different ways a batsman can be given out in the game of cricket. When a bowler gets a batsman out it is said that the bowler gets a 'wicket'. Following are the different ways, a batsman can be given out according to the rules of cricket:

Fig. 6.9: Bowled

![Image](outputs/jehp106/jehp106_artifacts/image_000015_509c7f48568f82ec031605a99c177517d76a402e9fcc1cbf221ab5fc45a23471.png)

- Bowled Cricket rules state that if the ball is bowled and hits the striking batsman's wickets the batsman is given out (as long as at least one bail is removed by the ball).  It  does  not  matter whether the ball has touched the  batsman's  bat,  gloves,  body  or  any  other  part  of the batsman. However, the ball is not allowed to have touched  another  player  or  umpire  before  hitting  the wickets.
- Caught Cricket rules state that if a batsman while playing the ball, either it touches his bat, hand or glove holding the bat then the batsman can be caught out. This is  done  by  the  fielders,  wicket  keeper  or  bowler catching the ball on the full (before it bounces). If this is done then cricket rules state the batsman is out.
- Leg before Wicket (LBW) If  the  ball  is  bowled and hits the .batsman first without touching the bat, then an LBW decision is possible. However for the umpire to give this out he must first look at some of the factors stated in the cricket rules. The first thing the umpire

![Image](outputs/jehp106/jehp106_artifacts/image_000016_d54303b21d153f7f152d903ee61db6c267ecb07646db0f0f9950e2662b896bbd.png)

# PAGE 11

need to decide is that if is not a no ball, would the ball have hit the wickets if the batsman was not there. If his, answer to this is yes and the ball was not pitched on the leg side of the wicket he can safely give the batsman out. However, if the ball hits the batsman outside the line  of  off  stump  while  he  was  attempting  to  play  a stroke then he is not out.

- Stumped A batsman can be given out according to cricket  rules  when  the  wicketkeeper  puts  down  his wicket while, he is out of his crease and not attempting a run (if he is attempting a run it would be a run out).
- Retired Out A batsman leaves the field without the permission  of  umpire  for  any  resource  like,  illness, injury etc. Than is given as retired out.
- Run Out Cricket rules state that a batsman is out if  no  part  of  his  bat  or  body  is  grounded  behind  the popping crease while the ball is in play and the wicket is fairly put down by the fielding side.
- Hit Wicket Cricket rules specify that if a batsman hits  his  wicket  down  with  his  bat  or  body  after  the bowler has entered his delivery stride and the ball is in play then he is out.
- Handled the Ball Cricket rules allow the batsman to be given out if he willingly handles the ball with the hand that is not touching the bat without the consent of the opposition or umpire.
- Timed Out An incoming batsman must be ready to face a ball or be at the non strikers end with his partner within  three  minutes  of  the  outgoing  batsman  being dismissed.  If  this  is  not  done  the  incoming  batsman can be given timed out.
- Hit  the  Ball  Twice  Cricket  rules  state  that  if  a batsman hits a ball twice other than for the purpose of  protecting  his  wicket  or  with  consent  from  the opposition, he is out.
- Obstructing  the  Field  A  batsman  is  out  if  he intentionally obstructs the opposition by word or action

There are many other cricket rules. However these are most of the basics and will get you well on your way to playing the game. Many of the more advanced rules and laws can be learned along the way and are not vital to general play.

If  any  batsman leaves the field of play without the Umpire's consent  for  any  reason  other  than  injury  or  incapacity, he  may  resume  the  innings  only  with  the  consent  of  the opposing captain. If he fails to resume his innings, he is out. For the purposes of calculating a batting average, retired out is considered a dismissal.

## Rules

- Cricket is a game played between two teams consisting of  eleven players each. There is also a reserve player called a twelfth man, who can only be utilized as fielder.
- The twelfth man is not allowed to ball, bat, and wicket keeping or captain the team. His sole duty is to act as a substitute fielder.
- Two umpires are placed on the playing field while there is also a third umpire off the field who is in charge of video decisions.
- When  the  call  is  too  close  for  the  on  field  umpires then they refer it to the third umpire who reviews slow motion video replays to make a decision.

## Batting techniques

- Defence
- Pull
- Hook

## Front foot defence

- The front  foot  defence  is  played  when  the  ball  is  bowled at a good length, which is not over-pitched enough for a drive and not short enough to go on the back foot.
- The front foot should move as close as possible to the pitch of the ball with the left shoulder and left elbow leading the body in the direction of the ball.
- The  weight  of  the  body  is  on  the  front  foot  with the knee bent and the head should be over the bat watching the point of contact. The bat is kept angled and very close to the front pad to prevent the ball going through bat and pad.
- The top hand is firm at the top of the handle while the bottom hand is relaxed, with the thumb and index finger loosely holding the bat. The back leg should be fully extended with the heel raised off the ground but remaining parallel to the crease.
- The weight of the back foot should be on the inside of the right toe and care should be taken not to turn it or drag it out of the crease.
- The front foot defensive stroke can be played with the bat slightly behind or in front of the pad depending on the nature of the wicket and the proficiency of the bowler.

## Off drive

- Off drive is played to an over-pitched ball in line with the off stump or marginally outside.
- Like the forward defence, the left shoulder and elbow lead the body with the front foot going as close as possible to the pitch of the ball. The bat comes down in and arc from the top of the back lift and strikes the ball just in front of the left foot.
- After  impact,  the  bat  must  continue  in  the  arc  and  finish over the left shoulder. The follow through can also be checked at shoulder height, keeping the bat face open.
- The head is kept straight and still throughout the shot and the top hand and elbow controls the direction of the shot. At the time of impact the head should be over the ball with the body weight balanced on the front foot. The full face of the bat must hit the ball and on completion, the batsman must be well balanced.
- Drive
- Cut
- Sweep

## Straight drive

- This shot is played exactly in the same way as an off drive but with the difference is that it is played to a over pitched ball in and around the line of middle stump and the front foot must point down the wicket and the body must be turned slightly and the shoulders opened out to allow the free swing of the bat.

## On drive

- On drive is played to a over-pitched ball on and around the leg stump.
- This has been considered to be a difficult shot to play. The basic principles of a drive apply here too, though the swing of the bat is an arc from slips to mid- on with the front pointing down the wicket.
- The front foot should be placed outside the line of ball with the shoulders turned and the impact is just in front  of  the  left  toe.  The  follow  through  is  generally checked below shoulder height.

## Back foot defence

- The back foot defensive stroke is played to a shortpitched ball in line  with  the  stumps,  which  is  not short enough to play and attacking shot.
- The back foot is moved back and across to the line of the ball with the front naturally following it. The bat is brought down close to the body with the head steady and over the ball.
- The back foot must remain parallel to the crease as far as possible to maintain the sideways position of the body with the top hand firm and in control, and the bottom hand holding the bat loosely.
- To keep the bat straight, the left elbow is held high next to the head. Care should be taken to maintain the  balance  at  the  time  of  playing  the  ball  and  to remain 'side-on' as this presents a smaller target for short rising deliveries.
- The back foot defence can also be played with the body beside the line of the ball, but here the batsman must resist the temptation to follow the movement of the ball away from him.

## Bowling skills

Bowling is as important as batting. The ball is defended by a batsman to save his wicket. When the ball is bowled to a batsman it is called as a ball or delivery.

## Types of bowling

| Fast bowling   | Spin bowling   |
|----------------|----------------|
| Seam bowling   | Off spin       |
| Swing bowling  | Leg spin       |
| Bouncer        | Chinaman       |
| In swinger     | Doosra         |
| Leg cutter     | Googly         |
| Off cutter     | Arm ball       |

## Swing bowling

- When a ball of a fast or medium fast bowler deviator in air either on leg side (in swing) or on off side (out swing) it is turned in air as swing bowling.

## Outswing

- For out swing bowling, the ball is held with the index and middle finger and thumb below the seam, which is  upright  &amp;  angled  towards the slips with the shiny surface on the right (for right hand bowler).
- For effective out swing bowling, the bowler should bowl as close as possible to the stumps.
- The wrist is cocked and when the ball is released the seam must be vertical and goes down the pitch upright. The two fingers should stay behind the seam as long as possible.

## Inswing

- Here, the ball is held by the two fingers and the thumb underneath it, with the seam upright and angle towards fine leg.
- The shiny side is on the left side and the fingers may also have a slight gap between them.

## Wicket keeping

The  wicket  keeper  plays  an  important  role  in  cricket. A good wicket keeper can save a number of runs for his team. His  function  is  to  stop  deliveries,  which  the  batsman  is unable to play or passed by batsman.

## Fielding

In  21st  century,  fielding  is  a  key  point  to  win  the  match. A player requires more hard work, practice and flexibility to become a good fielder.

## FootBall

Football  has  been  a  very  popular  game  all  over  the  world since  ages.  Also  commonly  known  as  soccer,  it  is  a  game that involves kicking a ball with the foot to score a point. It  is  played  between  two  teams  with  a  spherical  ball  on  a rectangular field of grass or green artificial turf. There is a goal post at each end of the rectangular field and errected at the middle of base line. Points are scored by moving the ball  to  an  opposing  team's  end  of  the  field  and  putting  it between two goal posts. Players are required to move the ball by kicking, dribbling, carrying, and passing. The team that scores more points than the other by the end of the match wins the game.

## History

According  to  FIFA  (Federation  International  de  Football Association), the 'very earliest form of the game was played in china during the second and third centuries. The game was later developed in England and the rules of football were formulated  in  India,  football  began  its  journey  when  the British rulers brought it with them and in no time it became popular in the masses. The first recorded game here took place between the 'Calcutta Club of Civilians' and the 'Gentlemen of Barrackpore' in 1854. The first ever football club in India, the 'Calcutta Football Club' was founded in 1872. The first football association, 'the Indian Football Association' (IFA) was established in Calcutta in 1893, though there was no Indian on its board till 1930s. It was later, replaced by All India Football Federation (AIFF). The Durand Cup Tournament is the oldest in India and the one of the oldest in the world, was started in Shimla in 1888. The decade of 1951 to 1962 is known as the golden era in the history of Indian football, as the country put up commendable performances in a number of international competitions. India won gold medals in 1951 and 1962 Asian Games, held at New Delhi and Jakarta.

## Field measurements

As per international standard, the length of the rectangular football field (pitch) is in the range of 100 to 110 m (110 to 120 yards) and the width is in the range of 65 to 75 m (70 to 80 yards). There are also goal posts at the back of each football zone. One way to score is to kick the football through the goal posts. The ball must go between the uprights and over the crossbar.

# PAGE 19

## Goal post

Distance between the posts is 7.32 meter whereas the height of the goal post is 2.44 meter.

## Rules

According to the official rules of football guide, the players need to execute the game in a fair and accepted manner. The football match is played in two halves of 45 minutes each. There are several rules in the game of football regarding the field, players, penalties, offence and defence.

## Start and restart of play

A coin toss takes place before the game starts, the winner of the toss will get the choice of choosing the end to attack. At the kick-off, all players from each side must be in their own halves of the field. The kick-off takes place on the centre spot in the centre circle. The player who kicks off cannot touch it again until another player has made contact.

## Punishment for offences

If the player persistently offends during a match, the referee can choose to take action. First the Yellow Card as a caution is shown to a player. Any offence after the second one leads to Red card. If they showed a red card to a player it means that player is expelled from the match. A straight red card (no previous  caution)  can  be  shown  for  extreme  offences,  such as,  serious  foul  play,  violent  conduct,  spitting,  deliberately handling the ball to prevent a goal, a professional foul (denying a  goal  scoring  opportunity)  and  insulting  language  and/or gestures.

## Free kicks

Whenever a free kick is taken, the players on the opposite side must be at least 10 yards away from the ball until it is kicked. If this rule is not adhered to, the kick is retaken. There are two types of free kicks awarded, depending on the nature of the offence: (i) Direct Free Kick - allows the team to take a direct shot at the opponent`s goal. (ii) Indirect Free Kick - a direct strike on goal is not permitted. It means a second player has to touch the ball after the kick is taken to score a goal.

## Penalty kick

A penalty kick is awarded for offences taking place in the penalty and goal areas. A nominated member of the team is allowed to strike at goal from the penalty spot, with only the goalkeeper to beat. The goalkeeper must remain on his line until the ball has been kicked, and all other players must be outside the penalty area behind the penalty spot. After the

player has taken the kick, that player cannot strike the ball again without another player touching the ball.

## Throw-in

A throw-in is awarded when the whole ball crosses the touch line  (conceded  by  the  team  who  last  touched  the  ball).  It is  delivered on the field of play with both hands and from behind and over the player's head. Otherwise it is deemed to be a foul throw and a throw-in is given to the opposition. It cannot go directly to the goalkeeper's hands (if on the same team). A goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in.

## Corner kick

A corner kick is awarded once the whole ball crosses the goal line  of  the  opposition,  after  touching  one  of  their  players. A kick is taken from the corner of whichever side the ball travelled over the field. Opponents must be 10 yards from the corner arc and the kicker cannot touch the ball a second time without having touched by any other player.

## Fundamental skills

## Receiving

Receiving a ball on the ground is different than receiving a ball in air. Keep your eye on the ball, select the foot to receive the ball, don't stop the ball, prepare it for new action or move, shot, dribble, pass.

## Passing

Passing involves giving the ball to partners. Perfect decision making  is  required  before  a  perfect  pass.  Before  pass, see the target, approach the ball, and look at the ball holding the  head  steady.  Strike  the  correct  area  of  the  ball  with lacked ankle, make sure of follow through and transfer of weight forward.

## Shooting

Shooting uses the same elements as used in passing, the difference is that the ball is to be passed to the goal keeper to convert the score for the team. Player should look up to see the position of goal keeper, choosing the area to shoot the ball while make a proper contact with the ball with proper follow through.

## Trapping

It is a method of gaining control of the ball. Trapping uses the feet, thigh, or chest to bring the ball to the ground.

# PAGE 21

## Techniques and lead-up activities

The students already learnt the fundamental techniques of playing football in the previous classes. Now let us discuss a few lead-up activities to develop these techniques.

## Ball control

Five versus two in 30m x 20m area. Players make two touches only to retain possession of the ball.

## Dribbling

Four quarters of the area are numbered. One player dribbles in  one  quarter  and  passes  the  ball  to  quarter  number  2 and so on. Reaching last quarter, the player without losing the ball gets points. If ball is lost in any quarter, the other teams start anti clockwise and then enter in to the next three quarters.

## Passing

Number of players-four. Rectangle measures 5m × 20m or 10m × 30 m, one ball.

## Heading

Two versus two, Goal of 8 yards, Centre line 5 yards from each goal.

## Shooting

Shooting board is a place along the penalty spot, arranged inside the penalty area.

## Tackling

One versus one, 10m × 10m area, time 2 minutes.

## Throw-ins

Throw-in is a competition between two players.

## Goal keeper

A goal keeper also acts as a defence but is allowed to catch or touch the ball with hands within the penalty box (D-area). A goal keeper is usually the last man standing at the goal to prevent opponents from scoring the goal.

## HoCkey

## Introduction

Field  Hockey  is  a  team  game,  in  which  a  team  of  players attempt  to  score  goals  by  hitting/Scooping,  pushing  or flicking  a  ball  into  an  opposing  team's  goal  using  curved sticks. However, the name Field Hockey is used in countries in which the word Hockey is generally reserved for another form  of  hockey,  such  as  ice  hockey  or  street  hockey. The  players  should  learn  and  practice  the  basic  skills  of dribbling,  passing,  tapping  and  hitting.  They  should  learn how to attack and score goals and how to work with others to defend and stop goals from being scored. To do this they need to learn how to keep possession by dribbling effectively and moving the ball accurately and quickly between players. As they progress, skills should become more consistent and efficient,  and  the  players  should be introduced to set play situations.

## History

The history of the game of hockey has its roots well laid in the world's early civilisations. One of the oldest known sports, the hockey game is believed to be in existence about 1200 years before  the  Ancient  Games  of  Olympia.  Right  from  Arabs, Greeks, Romans, and Persians to Ethiopians, every country played with a variation of the game. While some played it just

# PAGE 23

for recreation, the others had the opinion that hockey would make  them  better  warriors.  Even  though  many  ancient civilisations played hockey in different variations, the modern game of field hockey was developed in the British Isles in the 19th century. It was introduced in India by the British Army regiments and the game soon became popular. It was during this  time  that  the  London  Hockey  Association  was  formed and the rules for playing hockey were standardised. In 1924, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) was founded and three  years  later,  the  International  Federation  of  Women's Hockey followed.

In  India,  the  first  hockey  club  came  up  in  Calcutta  in 1885-86  and  soon  Bombay  and  Punjab  followed.  Making its  Olympic  debut  at  the  1928  Amsterdam  Games,  Indian hockey team won its first Olympic gold, without conceding a single goal. The hallmark of this ruthless domination was the  wizardry  of  Indian  hockey  legend,  Dhyan  Chand,  who mesmerised the Amsterdam crowd with his dazzling skills. From 1928 to 1956, India won six consecutive Olympic gold medals, while winning 24 consecutive matches. It was the golden era of Indian hockey, when India produced some of the finest players the game has ever seen.

Hockey  is  played  on  a  91.40  m  ×  55  m  rectangular  field. At each end there is a goal 2.14 m high 1.20 m deep and 3.66 m wide measured from the inner sides of the posts and crossbar, and the goal post is surrounded by an approximately semi-circular  area  14.63  m  from  the  goal  bounded  by a  solid  line.  A  spot  0.15m  in  diameter,  called  the  penalty spot,  is  marked  with  its  centre  6.40  m  from  the  centre  of each goal.

## Equipment

Each player carries a stick, normally a little over 3 feet (90 centimeters) long, 2 inches wide and traditionally made of wood but now often made with fiberglass, Kevlar and carbon fiber composites, with a rounded handle flattening out on one side and with a hook at the bottom.

## Rules

The rules set by the International Hockey Federation FIH are used worldwide.

## General play

Prior to the start of the game, a coin is tossed and the winning captain can choose a starting end or start with the ball. The game time is divided into four quarters of 15 minutes each 15-02-15-10-15-2-15. At the start of each quarter as well as after goals are scored, play is started with a pass from the centre of the field.

Field players may only play the ball with the flat side of the stick. Tackling is permitted as long as the tackler does  not  make  contact  with  the  attacker  or  his  stick before playing the ball (contact after the tackle may also be penalised if the tackle was made from a position where contact was inevitable). Further, the player with the ball may not deliberately use his body or stick to shield the ball from a legitimate tackle.

When the ball passes over the sidelines, it is returned to play from sideline either by individual player by himself or with a push or hit, taken by a member of the team whose players were not the last to touch the ball before crossing the sideline. If it crosses the goal line after last touched by an attacker, a 15 mt hit or pass can be made by any player of the defending team. A 15 mt hit is also awarded for  offenses  committed  by  the  attacking  side  within 15 mt of the end, of the pitch they are attacking.

## Free hits

Free hits are awarded when offences are committed outside the scoring circles. The ball may be hit or pushed once in any  direction  by  the  team  offended  against.  Opponents

# PAGE 25

must move 5 mt away from the ball when a free hit is awarded, and for attacking free hits within 5 mt of the circle, all attackers other than the one taking the hit must also be 5 mt away.

## Corner

A corner is awarded if the ball goes over the backline after last  being  touched  by  a  defender.  Corners  are  played  by the  attacking  team  and  involve  a  free  hit  from  the  22.90 meter line.

## Penalty corner

The  penalty  corner  is  set  play  that  is  awarded  against a  defending  team  when  any  offence  is  committed  in  the defensive  circle,  and  may  be  awarded  when  a  deliberate offence is committed in the defending 23 m area, or when the defending team deliberately plays the ball over the back line.

## Penalty stroke

A  penalty  stroke  is  awarded  when  defenders  commit  a deliberate  foul  in  the  circle  which  deprives  an  attacker  of possession or the opportunity to play the ball. This penalty is being taken by a single attacker against the goalkeeper, and is taken from a spot 6.4 m from the penalty spot and directly in front of the goal. The goalkeeper must stand with heels on the goal line, and cannot move his feet until the ball is played.

On the umpire's whistle, the striker may push or flick the ball at the goal, which the goalkeeper attempts to save. The player taking the penalty shot may not touch the ball twice. Hitting or dragging or tapping the ball is also forbidden. If the  shot  is  saved,  play  is  restarted  with  15  mt  hit  to  the defenders; if a goal is scored, play is restarted from the centre line. Time is stopped for the Penalty stroke.

## Dangerous play

If the ball is raised off the ground in a manner that is, in the umpire's opinion, dangerous, the ball is turned over to the other team and they receive a free hit from the point of contact.

## Tie breaker (shootout)

In  case  of  a  draw  match,  penalty  shootout  is  conducted. The winners will be decided by 5 penalty shootouts by each team and the team which scores highest number of goals is declared the winner. The shootout will start at 22.90 mt. line in front of the shooter and should be completed within 8 seconds after the umpire's whistle. The goalkeeper will start defence from goal line.

## VolleyBall

Volleyball is a net game that involves two teams of 12 players (six playing and six substitutes). Each team works together to  hit  an  inflated  ball  over  a  high  net.  Each  team  tries  to score points by grounding the ball on the other team's court. Volleyball is a rebound game where one cannot hold or catch the ball; every contact must be a rebound action. It is essential for  the  player  to  be  in  the  right  place  at  the  right  time  if the game is to be played in a controlled manner. Therefore, good  anticipation  and  movement  skills  should  be  taught to players. At competency level, students should learn and practice the basic skills of sending and receiving the ball over a high net. They should play simple 3 touch volleyball games working as a team to keep the ball in play and ground it on the opponent's side of the court.

Originally named Mintonette, it was created as a gentle indoor sport  for  older  players  to  be  able  to  exert  a  bit  of  athletic effort by keeping the ball in the air. The idea of using a net was borrowed from tennis. It was raised to a height above the  average  man's  height.  During  a  demonstration  game, someone remarked that the players seemed to be volleying the ball back and forth over the net, and perhaps 'volleyball' would be a more descriptive name for the sport. The game of Volleyball was invented by William G. Morgan in the year 1895  in  Holyoke,  Massachusetts  by  YMCA  (USA).  It  was invented as a recreational game. This game was brought to India more than 85 years ago when some physical education

teachers  had  been  abroad  and  were  trained  in  different games including Volleyball. YMCA  College of Physical Education, Madras, took this game seriously and students trained there have  taken  the  game  to  other  parts  of the country.

## Rules

Volleyball is a fast game played by two teams of 6 players each.  It  can  be  played  indoors  or  outdoors.  A  player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball from  behind  the  back  line  of  the  court,  over  the  net, and into the receiving team's court. The receiving team must  not  let  the  ball  be  grounded  within  their  court. The rally continues, with each team allowed up to three consecutive touches, until either a team grounds the ball on  the  opponent's  court  and  wins  the  rally  or  a  team commits a fault and loses the rally. The team that wins the rally is awarded a point, and serves the ball to start the next rally. The ball is usually played with the hands or arms, but players can legally strike or push the ball with any part of the body.

Common faults include -

- catching and throwing the ball;
- two  consecutive  contacts  with  the  ball  made  by  the same player;
- four  consecutive  contacts  with  the  ball  made  by  the same team;
- touching the net during play;
- crossing the centre line; and
- violation of rotation.

- Stand in a balanced position about half a meter from the net, feet shoulder width apart.
- Watch the opposition developing their attack and move quickly to where it is anticipated.
- Use side steps or cross steps to move along the net.
- Coordinate with the timings of the jump of attacker and raise hands above the net to block the smash.
- Move to receive passes: from a ready position, players should move right or left to receive a pass and return it.
- Play simple games that combine serving, overhead pass and underhand passes.
- Mark a chalk line  on  the  wall.  Practice  the  blocking action.  Jump  using  vigorous  knee  extension  and controlled  arm  movement.  Both  hands  must  touch simultaneously  above  the  mark.  Practice  blocking  at the net with one, two or three players.
