## Safety MeaSureS for HealtHy living

Our ancient scriptures give great emphasis on safe and sound life. Rigveda says, 'Self preservation is the first law of nature.' Thus, safety and security should be our primary concern. However, injuries and accidents cannot be predicted. These may occur anywhere and anytime. If they are not managed properly,  they  may  have  consequences  like  physical  or mental disability. Therefore, they need to be prevented and managed properly.  We  try  to  minimise  accidents  with  the help of safety measures. In this chapter we will be learning about precautions to keep ourselves safe and secure. First aid  is  essential  before  advanced  medical  care  is  available. Drug or substance abuse and its effects and prevention are also discussed in this chapter.

## Safety at the Work Place

Many injuries  and  accidents  are  reported  at  work  place  as well  as  in  playfield.  Factors  like  congested  space,  faulty equipments,  improper  methodology  and  carelessness  cause these. For example, while working with chemicals in chemistry laboratory, working with equipment in physics laboratory or on playground, one needs to be careful. Every action (with or without equipment) govern with proper rules and methodology which are helpful to minimise chances of accidents.

## Safety while working with machines

Machines,  whether  hand  operated  or  automatic,  make life  easy  and  comfortable.  But  they  may  be  the  cause  of physical  injuries  and  accidents  if  not  handled  carefully. There are certain dos and don'ts for safety while working on machines -

- Wash  hands  to  remove  oil  and  grease  or  use  chalk powder for proper handling.
- Avoid  wearing  loose  clothes.  They  can  get  entangled with machines.

- Concentrate on work and avoid talking.
- Switch off electricity if the machine is not in use.
- Keep extra or spare parts carefully in proper places so that they do not fall on any one.
- Avoid  touching  the  moving  parts  of  any  machine. This may tear-off the skin or cause burn due to heat.

## Certain safety equipment and gadgets are used in various areas -

- Helmets
- Spectacles
- Gloves
- Apron
- Insulating Boots
- Face Mask

## Handling insecticides

Insecticides  are  chemicals  or  herbs  to  kill  or  drive  away household and agriculture pests like rats, cockroaches, etc. While they are safe to use if proper instructions are followed but carelessness may cause serious accidents.

Common insecticides are -

1. sprays - agricultural insecticides that kill crop pests.
2. tablets  kept  in  grain  containers  to  control  grain insects.
3. naphthalene balls - used in cupboards and drawers to preserve clothes from clothes moth.

Certain dos and don'ts for safety while using insecticides are -

1. household insecticides
2. agriculture insecticides
3. insecticide tablets in grain containers

## Household insecticides

- Spray  cans  should  be  kept  away  from  children  and destroyed after use.
- Keep the nozzle of the insecticide container away from children.
- Container  used  for  spray  need  to  be  shaken  well before  use  otherwise  the  liquid  content  may  spoil your hand.
- One  should  read  the  information  brochure  attached with container and avoid frequent use of sprays.
- One should not keep the  windows and doors closed for long after the spray.

- Enlist five household insecticides.

## Do You Know?

Types of pesticides are

1. Insecticides
2. Larvicides
3. Herbicides
4. Fungicides
5. Bactericides
6. Rodenticides

- If accidently sprayed on your body parts, immediately wash with plenty of water and soap.
- If  pesticide  is  accidently  sprayed  on  your  clothes, remove them immediately.
- Do not use if any member of your family suffers from allergy and asthma.

## Agriculture insecticide

In addition to the precautions mentioned above, remember to -

- cover  your  body  parts  with  a  dress  used  for  this purpose. Wash this thoroughly after every scheduled spray and do not use it if not washed and dried. It can cause serious insecticide poisoning.
- cover your eyes and face with spectacles and mask.
- take a bath as soon as possible after the spray.

## Insecticide tablets in grain containers

- Always use the tablets after tying in a cloth piece.
- Wash hands with soap and water as soon as you touch the tablets.
- Keep the tablets out of reach of children.
- Remove the tablets before boiling rice or giving wheat for grinding.
- Shift the patient to the hospital if a tablet is ingested accidently.

## Handling electricity and electric gadgets

Electricity  is  a  boon  for  modern  civilisation.    However,  if due care is not taken while handling electricity and electric gadgets, it may prove fatal. For safe use of electric gadgets, follow the guidelines given below -

- Always use MCBs (Miniature Circuit Breakers) installed at main switch board.
- Immediately change the heated sockets and switches if there is sparking.
- Always  read  the  accompanying  instructions  before using the gadget.
- Do not touch any electric switch or gadget with moist hands.
- Do not leave the electric gadgets on, if not being used.

- Never be in close proximity with electric wires, fire and water. Always use dry sand in case of fire to douse it.
- Always get the servicing of the electrical gadgets done as per schedule.
- Use government approve d (ISI mark), electrical gadgets and fittings.

## firSt aid

You  must  have  met  with  certain  emergency  situations when you needed urgent medical treatment but it was not available immediately. You might have seen someone helping a person by providing first aid and then in reaching the hospital.

## What is First Aid?

First  aid  is  the  immediate  and  essential  temporary  care given to a wounded, injured or sick person, in an emergency situation  to  reduce  the  suffering  of  the  patient,  prevent further  complication  of  injury  or  sickness  before  availing professional medical assistance.

## Priorities of First Aid

Remember the following priorities before giving first aid -

1. Maintain ABC
- a) Airway: Clear the airway if blocked
- b) Breathing: Check  breathing  and  give  artificial respiration if necessary.
- c) Circulation: Give chest compressions if heart has stopped
2. Check and stop bleeding by applying pressure
3. Immobilise broken bones
4. Cool the burns
5. Treat eye, nose and ear injuries
6. Tie simple bandages and dressings over wounds
7. Transfer the patient to the nearest health centre

## When is First Aid required?

There are many conditions where first aid is required. You have studied a few in Class IX.

![Image](outputs/jehp110/jehp110_artifacts/image_000004_3e1fa0dbf1fe0fcdf5b975d4ceb0fcb6ec83e6acbe838827194ee2d5486645e6.png)

## Activity 10.2

- Discuss with your classmates the need of first aid.
- List the most essential items in a First Aid Box and draw a diagram.

## Do You Know?

C-A-B means -

- compression
- airways
- breathing

It helps to perform CPR.

# PAGE 5

The  can  be  following  situations  may  arise  where  you might need to provide first aid -

## The person is unconscious and not breathing

Here CPR (Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation) is required. It is a life saving measure used when the heart and breathing has stopped.

Starting CPR within three minutes of heart stoppage is very important or else brain will be damaged.

Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR): Circulation is maintained by chest compressions. Draw a line between the two nipples and keep the heel of the hand over the centre of  this  line.  Place  the  other  hand  over  it  and  give  chest compressions pressing down the breast bone 1.5 to 2 inches.

Fig. 10.1: Giving chest compressions

![Image](outputs/jehp110/jehp110_artifacts/image_000005_27907c03b41353d3b3d6a1db321f628b3b551770b87ceb3bd375adc0d2e099d2.png)

The ratio of chest compressions to breathing should be 30:2 (i.e. 30 chest compressions and 2 artificial breaths per minute) as we have to provide a heart rate of approximately 100 beats per minute.

Open the airway: The airway is cleared by finger sweep  if  required.  Any  foreign body, secretion, food, broken teeth  or  tongue  falling  back  are removed.

The  airway  is  kept  open  by tilting  the  head  backwards  and lifting the chin upwards.

- C- Cardio means heart,
- P-   Pulmonary means lungs and
- R-   Resuscitation means to revive

## Do You Know?

- CPR  (Cardio  Pulmonary Resuscitation) must be given soon after breathing has stopped.
- If  you  are  untrained then  give  CPR  only through hands for 100-120  per  minute and continue until signs  of  movements or  medical  help  has arrived.

## Activity 10.3

Observe the activity perform by teacher and do activity under the supervision of the teacher.

Breathing: Breathing is artificially conducted by mouth to mouth technique. Keep your handkerchief over the mouth of the unconscious person. Pinch the nose of the person with one hand while tilting the head backwards and lifting the chin upwards.

Continue CPR till either the person is revived or medical help arrives.

## The person is unconscious and  breathing

Place  the  unconscious  casualty  in  recovery  position  as explained in Fig. 10.4.

- Extend the arm nearest up alongside the person's head.
- Bring the other arm across the person's chest and place the back of the hand against the cheek.
- Grasp the leg just above the knee and pull it up so that the foot is flat on the ground.
- Roll  the  person  far  enough  for  the  face  to  be  angled forward.
- Position the elbow and knee to help stabilise the head and body

## MedicineS and their effectS on individualS

Medicines are chemicals and biochemical substances which are used to prevent, cure or correct deficiency disorders in the body. Many substances have been used as medicines since ages in one or the other form, but modern times have seen a tremendous growth in terms of types and usage of medicines. While medicines are used to treat diseases and can be life saving, they can harm the body if not used correctly.

Medicines  are  used  in  the  form  of  injections,  tablets, syrups,  creams,  lotions,  solutions,  drops,  powder,  sprays and straps.

Medicines  affect  us  in  many  ways.    Some  of  the  common ways are -

- Analgesics - reducing pain and in fever.
- Antibodies - killing or weakening microbes and infections.
- Lotions - in burns and allergies, for soothing effect.
- Supplements - correcting deficiencies due to vitamins, nutrients.
- Antipsychotic drugs - modifying the body's response, psychological disorders.
- Vaccines and inoculations and immunisation  Protecting and preventing.
- Hormones - supporting physiological functions.
- Herbal medicines - plants herbs

Although  medicines assist us to lead a healthy life free of diseases, there are also certain undesirable effects  due to

## Activity 10.4

Let us learn about common medicines, their effects and what happens if they are used incorrectly.

# PAGE 7

mechanism of action of the medicine or if taken more than the  recommended  dose.  Thus,  it  is  important  to  take  the medicines only under medical supervision.

## Precautions while taking medicines

Medicines need to be used in the required dose so that they should  not  only  have  the  desired  effect  but  also  prevent undesired side effects. Some of the precautions while taking medicines are -

- Take  medicines  only  if  prescribed  by  a  doctor.  Self medication may be dangerous.
- Take  the  recommended  dose  of  the  medicine  and  at the prescribed interval. Only then there will be desired effects. One should never adjust the dose oneself.
- Do not minimise or exceed the dose and frequency of taking the medicine. This can cause undesirable effects
- Adult dose of medicines should not be given to children. There  are  special  forms  and  doses  of  medicines  for children. Keep all medicines out of reach of children. Ingestion by them may cause emergency.
- Store  the  medicines  away  from  extreme  temperature and sunlight.
- Always  check  the  expiry  date  of  medicines  before consumption.
- Use a  full  cup  of  water  and  drink  standing  upright while swallowing a tablet.
- Do not take any medicine on an empty stomach unless prescribed by the doctor.
- Keep a list of medicines one is allergic to. Always tell the doctor about such medicine(s).
- Always visit the doctor if one experiences any unusual symptom while taking the prescribed medicines.
- It  is  important  that  the  medicine  should  be  taken regularly  for  the  entire  period  and  duration  as  prescribed by the doctor. Otherwise the disease due to infections can return.

## SubStance (drug) abuSe

In an  effort to establish their identity and  desire  for experimentation,  adolescents  often  try  out  new  things. Also  they  are  more  amenable  to  external  influences,  such as, the media and peers. This makes them more vulnerable to  substance  misuse,  especially  when  they  do  not  have correct and scientific information. They also lack life skills to deal with the wide ranging negative outcomes of extreme dependency on a substance and thereby,  getting  addicted to it.

## What is substance abuse?

As  you  have  learnt,  drugs  affect  the  body  by  changing the  mental  and  physical  status  of  a  person.  Some  other substances also work in the same way and are not necessarily drugs.  The non-medical use of a substance including drugs, that changes an individual's mental and physical status and affect the health adversely, is known as substance abuse.

Once a person starts using a substance, his mental state is altered and the person cannot get out of this habit. The extreme  dependency  on  the  substance  compels  them  to increase the intake every day. This is called addiction.

Substance misuse is widespread today including adolescents  across  the  world.    Socially  acceptable  drugs like tobacco and alcohol abuse not only ruins the life of the individual  but  can  also  influence  them  to  associated  with crime and violence.

## Commonly abused substances

There  are  substances  that  can  be  abused  for  their  moodaltering effects such as inhalants and solvents. On the other hand, there are drugs that can be abused that have no moodaltering or intoxication properties, such as, anabolic steroids. They are abused by the adolescents and youth during body building, to look more muscular.

Commonly  abused  substances  are  tobacco,  alcohol, marijuana ( ganja ),  opium,  cannabis, solvents (petrol, glue, correction ink) and aerosols inhalants, cough syrup, caffeine, cocaine and ecstasy.  There are other substances like gutka and paan (betel).

These  substances  can  be  ingested,  inhaled,  drunk, chewed or injected by a syringe in the blood.  Some of these substances make one addicted, even if taken once.

## Reasons for substance abuse in young people

Young people are more vulnerable to substance abuse due to the following reasons -

- During the process of growing up, poor self-esteem, low achievement  at  school,  performance  pressures,  etc,. are some of the factors that promote substance abuse in adolescence.  Resorting to substance use as a means of 'growing up' or fun also makes the adolescents more vulnerable to substance abuse.
- Pressure  from  peers  or  friends  to  try  an  addictive substance, the urge to gain popularity among friends, and desire to experiment and curiosity to try out new things also make young people particularly vulnerable to substance abuse.

# PAGE 9

- Previous experience of taking substance.
- Family history of substance misuse.
- Lack of support from family, friends and school.
- Lack  of  knowledge  about  the  effects  and  dangers  of consuming addictive substances.
- Glamorising  substance  misuse    by  media  misleads young people.
- Easy availability of substances and drugs are the main reasons for substance misuse in young people.
- Social approval of substance abuse like tobacco, paan, beetel  nut, gutka chewing  or  taking  wine  in  parties encourages  young  people  to  initiate  abuse  of  these substances.

## CASE 1

Sohan has performed well in Class IX annual exams. Now, he is worried whether he will be able to keep up his performance and score good grades in Class X. His parents always tell him how they expect to see him at the top of his class.  Afraid of  disappointing  them,  Sohan  does  not  share  his  concerns with  his  parents.  He  feels  that  some  of  his  friends  may  be going through the same phase and discusses his problem with them. His friends suggest that smoking may reduce his stress and help him to relax. Sohan wants to feel better and decides to follow his friends' advice. He starts smoking a cigarette or two everyday.  Without realising, over a period of six months he was smoking 6-10 cigarettes a day. Smoking has become a habit with him, and in future, it was the cause of his ill health.

## Points for Discussion

- a)  What do you think is responsible for Sohan's habit of smoking and why?
- b) Do  you  think  smoking  helped  reduce  Sohan's  stress? Why?
- c)  What else could Sohan have done to reduce his stress effectively?
- d)  What role could Sohan's parents have played to prevent him from smoking?

## Consequences of substance abuse

Substance misuse leads to a number of short-term and longterm effects that are detrimental to health.

Short-term effects: These are effects that appear only a few minutes after the intake of substance. The user feels a  false  sense  of  well-being  and  a  pleasant  drowsiness. Some of the short-term effects are distorted vision, hearing and  coordination,  impaired  judgment,  bad  breath  and hangovers.

## Activity 10.6

Discuss how a substance abuser's life gets affected.

Long-term  effects: Substances  having  a  long-term impact lead to serious damage due to constant and excessive use. These effects show up over a course of time and are usually  caused  by  progressive  damage  to  different  body organs. Some of the health consequences include irregular eating  habits,  sleep  disorders,  poor  hygiene  resulting  in poor health and low immunity. This predisposes substance abuser to diseases and infections.

Substance abuse in itself is not a cause of HIV/AIDS or STDs but under the influence of drugs, people may engage in  risk-behaviours  that  make  them  more  susceptible  to these infections. Injectable drug users, however, are more prone to HIV in conditions where the users do not sterilise needles and share needles to inject the drug.

Substance users may even die suddenly from a so-called overdose,  when  one  consumes  more  than  what  the  body can tolerate. Death may also occur from long-term damage to the organs of the body.

These  substances  are  especially  harmful  if  consumed during  pregnancy.  These  substances  reach  the  foetus through  blood  and  harm  it  by  crippling  its  growth  and development or death.

Substance  abuse  influences  not  only  the  individual and family but also the community. The persons who get addicted often lose interest in other activities be it school, job or any other responsibility. They are not able to take care  of  their  responsibilities  and  may  become  a  liability for their families and finally the society. Furthermore, it is expensive to buy substances or drugs on a regular basis. Hence, in desperation, addicted individuals may be forced to engage in petty severe crimes.

## Prevention of drug abuse

Paying attention to the following may prevent young people from misusing substances -

- Peer  pressure  can  be  managed  by  being  aware  of the implications of substance abuse and developing life skills.  One  can  not  only  save  oneself  from adopting risky  behaviours  under  peer  pressure  but also persuade the peers not to engage in unhealthy behaviours  such  as  substance  misuse.  Advocacy with the involvement of local community can be quite useful.
- The  different  ways  of  dealing  with  negative  peer pressure  are saying 'No' assertively,  making  an excuse, reversal of pressure, and giving reasons.
- Young people should also be educated to recognise that a friend is someone who cares, protects and looks

# PAGE 11

- after the welfare of their friends rather than force and initiate into unhealthy habits.
- Young people should be empowered with life skills to know about their body and their life. They should be taking well-informed and responsible decisions.
- The  family  and  society  should  provide  the  support system for young children in their 'low' times.
- As  the  attitudes  related  to  smoking,  drinking  and misuse of other substances are formed during pre-adolescence  and  early  adolescence,  this  is  an important  age  to  invest  in  prevention  efforts.  The family, community and educational institutions should  empower  young  people  with  correct  and scientific information.

Young children should be encouraged to get engaged in  socially  productive  activities.  For  example,  one  can start a learning centre for the lesser advantaged children in  the  neighbourhood, one can learn Braille and help at blind school, and one can create awareness about water conservation in the neighbourhood. This will help them to channelise  their  energy,  being  away  from  the  menace  of substance abuse and also inculcate social responsibility
