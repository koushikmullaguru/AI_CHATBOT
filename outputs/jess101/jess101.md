Can you identify and name the various items used in making life comfortable in our villages and towns. List  the  items  and  name  the material used in their making.

Everything  available  in  our  environment which  can  be  used  to  satisfy  our  needs, provided,  it  is  technologically  accessible, economically  feasible  and  culturally acceptable  can  be  termed  as  'Resource'.

The  process  of  transformation  of  things available  in  our  environment  involves  an interactive  relationship  between  nature, technology and institutions. Human beings interact with nature through technology and create  institutions  to  accelerate  their economic development.

Do  you  think  that  resources  are  free gifts  of  nature  as  is  assumed  by  many? They  are  not.  Resources  are  a  function  of human activities. Human beings themselves are essential components of resources. They transform  material  available  in  our environment into resources and use them. These  resources  can  be  classified  in  the following ways-

- (a) On the basis of origin - biotic and abiotic
- (b) On the basis of  exhaustibility  -  renewable and non-renewable
- (c) On  the  basis  of  ownership  -  individual, community, national and international
- (d) On  the  basis  of  status  of  development  potential,  developed  stock  and  reserves.

## DEVELOPMENT OF  RESOURCES

Resources are vital for human survival as well as for maintaining the quality of life. It was believed that resources are free gifts of nature. As  a  result,  human  beings  used  them indiscriminately  and  this  has  led  to  the following major problems.

- Depletion  of  resources  for  satisfying  the greed of a few individuals.
- Accumulation of resources in few hands, which, in turn, divided the society into two segments i.e. haves  and have nots or rich and poor.
- Indiscriminate exploitation of resources has led to global ecological crises such as, global warming, ozone layer depletion, environmental pollution and land degradation.
1. Imagine, if the oil supply gets exhausted one day, how would this affect our life style?
2. Plan a survey in your colony/village to investigate  people's  attitude  towards recycling  of  the  domestic/agricultural wastes. Ask questions about :
- (a) What do they think about resources they use?
- (b) What is  their  opinion  about  the wastes, and its utilisation?
- (c) Collage your results.

An equitable distribution of resources has become essential for a sustained quality of life and  global  peace.  If  the  present  trend  of resource depletion by a few individuals and countries continues, the future of our planet is in danger.

Therefore, resource planning is essential for sustainable  existence  of  all  forms  of  life. Sustainable  existence  is  a  component  of sustainable development.

## Sustainable development

Sustainable economic development means 'development should take place without damaging the environment, and development in the present should not compromise with the needs of the future generations.'

## Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, 1992

In June 1992, more than 100 heads of states met in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, for the first International Earth Summit. The Summit was convened for addressing urgent problems of environmental  protection  and  socioeconomic development at the global level. The  assembled  leaders  signed  the Declaration on Global Climatic Change and Biological  Diversity.  The  Rio  Convention endorsed the global Forest Principles and adopted Agenda  21 for achieving Sustainable Development in the 21 st  century.

## Agenda 21

It is the declaration signed by world leaders in 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), which took place at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It aims  at  achieving  global  sustainable development. It is  an  agenda  to  combat environmental damage, poverty, disease through global co-operation on common interests,  mutual  needs  and  shared responsibilities. One major objective of the Agenda 21 is that every local government should draw its own local Agenda 21.

## RESOURCE PLANNING

Planning is the widely accepted strategy for judicious use of resources. It has importance in a country like India, which has enormous diversity in the availability of resources. There are regions which are rich in certain types of resources  but  are  deficient  in  some  other

# PAGE 3

resources. There are some regions which can be considered self sufficient in terms of the availability of resources and there are some regions which have acute shortage of some vital resources.  For  example,  the  states  of Jharkhand,  Chhattisgarh  and  Madhya Pradesh are rich in minerals and coal deposits. Arunachal Pradesh has abundance of water resources  but  lacks  in  infrastructural development. The state of Rajasthan is very well endowed with solar and wind energy but lacks in water resources. The cold desert of Ladakh is  relatively  isolated  from  the  rest  of  the country. It has very rich cultural heritage but it is deficient in water, infrastructure and some vital minerals. This calls for balanced resource planning at the national, state, regional and local levels.

Prepare a list of resources found in your state and also  identify  the  resources  that  are important but deficit in your state.

## Resource Planning in India

Resource  planning  is  a  complex  process which  involves  :  (i)  identification  and inventory of resources across the regions of the  country.  This  involves  surveying, mapping and qualitative  and  quantitative estimation  and  measurement  of  the resources. (ii) Evolving a planning structure endowed with appropriate technology, skill and institutional  set  up  for  implementing resource development plans. (iii) Matching the resource development plans with overall national development plans.

India  has  made  concerted  efforts  for achieving the goals of resource planning right from the First Five Year Plan launched after Independence.

The availability of resources is a necessary condition for the development of any region, but  mere  availability  of  resources  in  the absence  of  corresponding  changes  in

What resources are being developed in your surroundings  by  the  community/village panchayats/ward level communities with the help of community participation?

technology  and  institutions  may  hinder development. There are many regions in our country that are rich in resources but these are  included  in  economically  backward regions. On the contrary there are some regions which have a poor resource base but they are economically developed.

Can  you  name  some  resource  rich  but economically  backward  regions  and  some resource  poor  but  economically  developed regions? Give reasons for such a situation.

The history  of colonisation reveals that rich  resources  in  colonies  were  the  main attractions for the foreign invaders. It was primarily  the  higher  level  of  technological development of the colonising countries that helped  them  to  exploit  resources  of  other regions and establish their supremacy over the  colonies.  Therefore,  resources  can contribute to development only when they are accompanied by appropriate technological development and institutional changes. India has experienced all this in different phases of colonisation. Therefore, in India, development, in  general,  and  resource  development  in particular  does  not  only  involve  the availability  of  resources,  but  also  the technology, quality of human resources and the historical experiences of the people.

Conservation of Resources: Resources are vital  for  any  developmental  activity.  But irrational consumption and over-utilisation of resources may lead to socio-economic and environmental problems. To overcome these problems, resource conservation at various levels is important. This had been the main concern of the leaders and thinkers in the past. For example, Gandhiji was very apt in voicing  his  concern  about  resource conservation in these words: 'There is enough

for everybody's need and not for any body's greed.'  He  placed  the  greedy  and  selfish individuals and exploitative nature of modern technology  as  the  root  cause  for  resource depletion at the global level. He was against mass production and wanted to replace it with the production by the masses.

At the international level, the Club of Rome advocated resource conservation for the first time  in  a  more  systematic  way  in  1968. Subsequently, in 1974, Gandhian philosophy was once again presented by Schumacher in his book Small is Beautiful . The seminal contribution  with  respect  to  resource conservation at the global level was made by the Brundtland Commission Report, 1987. This  report  introduced  the  concept  of 'Sustainable Development' and advocated it  as  a  means  for  resource  conservation, which was subsequently published in a book entitled Our Common Future .  Another significant contribution was made at the Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992.

## LAND RESOURCES

We live  on  land,  we  perform  our  economic activities on land and we use it in different ways.  Thus,  land  is  a  natural  resource  of utmost  importance.  It  supports  natural vegetation,  wild  life,  human  life,  economic activities,  transport  and  communication systems. However, land is an asset of a finite magnitude, therefore, it is important to use the

available land for various purposes with careful planning.

India  has  land  under  a  variety  of  relief features, namely; mountains, plateaus, plains and islands. About 43 per cent of the land area is plain, which provides facilities for agriculture and industry. Mountains account for 30 per cent of the total surface area of the country and ensure perennial flow of some rivers, provide facilities for tourism and ecological aspects. About  27 per cent of the area of the country is the plateau region. It possesses rich reserves of minerals, fossil fuels and forests.

## LAND UTILISATION

Land resources are used for the following purposes:

1. Forests
2. Land not available for cultivation
3. (a) Barren and waste land
4. (b) Land put to non-agricultural uses, e.g. buildings, roads, factories, etc.
3. Other  uncultivated  land  (excluding fallow land)
6. (a) Permanent pastures and grazing land,
7. (b) Land under miscellaneous tree crops groves (not included in net  sown area),
8. (c) Culturable waste land (left uncultivated for more than 5 agricultural years).
4. Fallow lands
10. (a) Current fallow-(left without cultivation for one or less than one agricultural year),
11. (b) Other  than  current  fallow-(left uncultivated  for  the  past  1  to  5 agricultural years).
5. Net sown area- the physical extent of land on  which  crops  are  sown  harvested  is known as net sown area.
13. Area  sown  more  than  once  in  an agricultural  year  plus  net  sown  area  is known as gross cropped area .

## LAND USE PATTERN IN INDIA

The use of land is determined both by physical factors such as topography, climate, soil types as well as human factors such as population density, technological capability and culture and traditions etc.

Moreover, some areas of Jammu and Kashmir occupied by Pakistan and China have also not been surveyed.

of such land is very high. Hence, these lands are cultivated once or twice in about two to three years and if these are included in the net sown area then the percentage of NSA in India comes to  about 54 per cent of the total reporting area.

Try to do a comparison between the two pie charts (Fig. 1.4 ) given for land use and find out  why  the  net  sown  area  and  the  land under forests have changed from 1960-61 to 2019-20 very marginally.

The land under permanent pasture has also decreased. How are we able to feed our huge cattle population on this pasture land and what are the consequences of it? Most of the other than the current fallow lands are either of poor quality or the cost of cultivation

The pattern of net sown area varies greatly from one state to another.  It is over 80 per cent of the total area in Punjab and Haryana and  less  than  10  per  cent  in  Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Manipur and Andaman Nicobar Islands.

fringes of these forests depends upon it. A part of the land is termed as waste land and land put to other non-agricultural uses. Waste land includes rocky, arid and desert areas and land put to other non-agricultural uses includes settlements, roads, railways, industry etc. Continuous use of land over a long period of time without taking appropriate measures to conserve and manage it, has resulted in land degradation.  This,  in  turn,  has  serious repercussions on society and the environment.

## LAND  DEGRADATION  AND  CONSERVATION MEASURES

We  have  shared  our  land  with  the  past generations and will have to do so with the future generations too. Ninety-five per cent of our basic needs for food, shelter and clothing are obtained from land. Human activities have not only brought about degradation of land but have also aggravated the pace of natural forces to cause damage to land.

Some human  activities such as deforestation,  over  grazing,  mining  and quarrying too have contributed significantly in land degradation.

Mining  sites  are  abandoned  after excavation  work  is  complete  leaving  deep scars and traces of over-burdening. In states like  Jharkhand,  Chhattisgarh,  Madhya Pradesh  and  Odisha  deforestation  due  to mining have caused severe land degradation. In  states  like  Gujarat,  Rajasthan,  Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra overgrazing is one of the main reasons for land degradation. In the states of Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh, over irrigation is responsible for land degradation due to water logging leading to increase in salinity and alkalinity in the soil. The  mineral  processing  like  grinding  of limestone for cement industry and calcite and soapstone for ceramic industry generate huge quantity of dust in the atmosphere. It retards the process of infiltration of water into the soil after it settles down on the land. In recent years,  industrial  effluents  as  waste  have become a major source of land and water pollution in many parts of the country.

CONTEMPORARY  INDIA - II

There are many ways to solve the problems of land degradation. Afforestation and proper management of grazing can help to some extent. Planting of shelter belts of plants, control on over grazing, stabilisation of sand dunes by growing  thorny  bushes  are  some  of  the methods to check land degradation in arid areas.  Proper  management of waste lands, control of mining activities, proper discharge and disposal of industrial effluents and wastes after  treatment  can  reduce  land  and  water degradation in industrial and suburban areas.

## SOIL AS A RESOURCE

Soil is the most important renewable natural resource. It  is  the  medium  of  plant  growth and supports different types of living organisms on the earth. The soil is a living system. It takes  millions of years to form soil upto a few cm in depth. Relief, parent rock or bed rock, climate, vegetation and other forms of life and time are important factors in the formation of soil. Various forces of nature such as change in temperature, actions of running water, wind and glaciers,  activities  of  decomposers  etc. contribute to the formation of soil. Chemical and organic changes which take place in the

# PAGE 7

soil are equally important. Soil also consists of  organic  (humus)  and  inorganic  materials (Fig. 1.5).

On the basis of the factors responsible for soil formation, colour, thickness, texture, age, chemical and physical properties, the soils of India are classified in different types.

## Classification of Soils

India  has  varied  relief  features,  landforms, climatic realms and vegetation types. These have contributed in the development of various types of soils.

## Alluvial  Soils

This is the most widely spread and important soil.  In  fact,  the  entire  northern  plains  are made  of  alluvial  soil.  These  have  been deposited by three important Himalayan river systems-  the  Indus,  the  Ganga  and  the Brahmaputra. These soils  also  extend  in Rajasthan and Gujarat through a narrow corridor.  Alluvial  soil  is  also  found  in  the eastern coastal plains particularly in the deltas of the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri rivers.

Fig. 1.6: Alluvial Soil

![Image](outputs/jess101/jess101_artifacts/image_000015_e260523e9f68ba1b1b9b121f9fd0fac4973b457fc011abf7d59c90cfaebc0532.png)

The  alluvial  soil  consists  of  various proportions of sand, silt and clay. As we move inlands towards the river valleys, soil particles appear some what bigger in size. In the upper reaches of the river valley i.e. near the place of the break of slope, the soils are coarse. Such soils  are  more  common in piedmont plains such as Duars, Chos and Terai .

Apart  from  the  size  of  their  grains  or components, soils are also described on the basis  of  their  age.  According  to  their  age alluvial soils can be classified as old alluvial ( Bangar )  and  new  alluvial  ( Khadar ).  The bangar soil has higher concentration of kanker nodules than the Khadar. It  has  more  fine particles and is more fertile than the bangar .

Alluvial soils as a whole are very fertile. Mostly these soils contain adequate proportion of  potash,  phosphoric  acid  and  lime  which are ideal for the growth of sugarcane, paddy, wheat and other cereal and pulse crops. Due to its high fertility, regions of alluvial soils are intensively cultivated and densely populated. Soils in the drier areas are more alkaline and can be productive after proper treatment and irrigation.

## Black Soil

These soils are black in colour and are also known as regur soils. Black soil is ideal for growing cotton and is also known as black cotton soil . It is believed that climatic condition along with the parent rock material are the important factors for the formation of black soil. This type of soil is typical of the Deccan trap  ( Basalt )  region  spread  over  northwest Deccan plateau and is made up of lava flows. They  cover  the  plateaus  of  Maharashtra, Saurashtra,  Malwa,  Madhya  Pradesh  and Chhattisgarh and extend in the south east direction along the Godavari and the Krishna valleys.

Fig. 1.7: Black Soil

The black soils are made up of extremely fine i.e. clayey material. They are well-known for their capacity to hold moisture. In addition, they are rich in soil nutrients, such as calcium carbonate, magnesium, potash and lime. These

India: Major Soil Types

# PAGE 9

soils are generally poor in phosphoric contents. They develop deep cracks during hot weather, which helps in the proper aeration of the soil. These soils are sticky when wet and difficult to work on unless tilled immediately after the first shower or during the pre-monsoon period.

## Red and Yellow Soils

Red soil develops on crystalline igneous rocks in  areas  of  low  rainfall  in  the  eastern  and southern parts of the Deccan plateau. Yellow and  red  soils  are  also  found  in  parts  of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, southern parts of the middle Ganga plain and along the piedmont zone of the Western Ghats. These soils develop a reddish colour due to diffusion of iron in crystalline and metamorphic rocks. It looks yellow when it occurs in a hydrated form.

## Laterite Soil

Laterite has been derived from the Latin word 'later'  which  means  brick.  The  laterite  soil develops  under  tropical  and  subtropical climate  with  alternate  wet  and  dry  season. This soil is the result of intense leaching due to heavy rain. Lateritic soils are mostly deep to  very  deep,  acidic  (pH&lt;6.0),  generally deficient in plant nutrients and occur mostly in southern states, Western Ghats region of Maharashtra, Odisha, some parts of West Bengal and North-east regions. Where these soils  support  deciduous  and  evergreen forests, it is humus rich, but under sparse

vegetation and in semi-arid environment, it is generally  humus  poor.  They  are  prone  to erosion and degradation due to their position on the landscape. After adopting appropriate soil  conservation techniques particularly in the hilly areas of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, this soil is very useful for growing tea and coffee. Red laterite soils in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala are more suitable for crops like cashew nut.

## Arid Soils

Arid soils range from red to brown in colour. They are generally sandy in texture and saline in nature.  In some areas the salt content is very  high  and  common salt  is  obtained  by evaporating the water. Due to the dry climate, high temperature, evaporation is faster and the soil lacks humus and moisture. The lower horizons of the soil are occupied by Kankar because of the increasing calcium content downwards. The Kankar layer formations in the bottom horizons restrict the infiltration of water.  After  proper  irrigation  these  soils become cultivable as has been in the case of western Rajasthan.

## Forest  Soils

These  soils are  found  in  the  hilly  and mountainous areas where sufficient  rain forests are available.  The soils texture varies according  to  the  mountain  environment where they are formed.  They are loamy and silty in valley sides and coarse grained in the upper slopes. In the snow covered areas

of  Himalayas,  these  soils  experience denudation and are acidic with low humus content.  The soils found in the lower parts of the valleys particularly on the river terraces and alluvial fans are fertile.

## Soil Erosion and Soil Conservation

The  denudation  of  the  soil  cover  and subsequent washing down is described as soil erosion. The processes of soil formation and erosion, go on simultaneously and generally there is a balance between the two. Sometimes, this  balance  is  disturbed  due  to  human activities  like  deforestation,  over-grazing, construction and mining etc., while natural forces  like  wind,  glacier  and  water  lead  to soil erosion. The running water cuts through the clayey soils and makes deep channels as gullies . The land becomes unfit for cultivation and is known as bad land . In the Chambal basin  such  lands  are  called  ravines. Sometimes water flows as a sheet over large areas down a slope. In such cases the top

soil is washed away. This is known as sheet erosion .  Wind  blows  loose  soil  off  flat  or sloping  land  known  as  wind  erosion.  Soil erosion is also caused due to defective methods of farming. Ploughing in a wrong way i.e. up and down the slope form channels for the quick flow of water leading to soil erosion.

Ploughing  along  the  contour  lines  can decelerate the flow of water down the slopes. This is called contour ploughing. Steps can be  cut  out  on  the  slopes  making  terraces. Terrace cultivation restricts erosion. Western and central Himalayas have well developed terrace farming. Large fields can be divided into strips. Strips of grass are left to grow between the crops. This breaks up the force of the wind. This  method  is  known  as  strip  cropping. Planting lines of trees to create shelter also works in a similar way. Rows of such trees are called shelter belts. These shelter belts have contributed significantly to the stabilisation of sand dunes and in stabilising the desert in western India.
