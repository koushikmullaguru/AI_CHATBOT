S = [2 ( 1) ], 2 + -n a n d we get, 41 n -n 2 = 400. On solving, n = 16, 25. Therefore, the number of rows is either 16 or 25. a 25 = a + 24 d = - 4

i.e., number of logs in 25th row is - 4 which is not possible. Therefore n = 25 is not possible. For n = 16, a 16 = 5. Therefore, there are 16 rows and 5 logs placed in the top row.

25. (i) Incorrect. We can classify the outcomes like this but they are not then 'equally likely'. Reason is that 'one of each' can result in two ways - from a head on first coin and tail on the second coin or from a tail on the first coin and head on the second coin. This makes it twicely as likely as two heads (or two tails).
