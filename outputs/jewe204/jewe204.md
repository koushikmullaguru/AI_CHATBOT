## Let's Begin

The World Wars fought in the past stand testimony to the fact that fighting wars brings severe human suffering. The sufferers, including women and children are left behind with trauma and indelible  impressions  on  their  minds.  You  have  read  in  the C lass  X  English  textbook  the  account  of  one  such  war  in  the diary  of  Anne  Frank  who  captured  the  miseries  of  war  in  her diary. Discuss how you may relate to Anne Frank's feelings of alienation and isolation.

## Reading CompRehension text i

The  following  excerpt  is  from  the  diary  of  Lena  Mukhina,  a teenage girl who had undergone the atrocities of Germans when they  fortified  the  city  of  Leningrad.  The  siege  of  Leningrad  is an  important  landmark  in  the  history  of  Russia.  The  siege  of Leningrad lasted from September 1941 to 1944. The city was cut off from the rest of Russia. The Germans continuously bombarded the city which resulted in death, destruction, and starvation of the people. However, the resolute Russians were warned in the beginning that the enemy was at the gate and it was a question of life and death. They fought bravely and failed the Germans in their evil designs.

Read the excerpt and answer the questions that follow.

## Foreword from The Diary of Lena Mukhina

No one could possibly have known that the city would remain in the grip of siege for 872 days and nights. But Leningrad's citizens had begun to feel the breath of war as early as September. Daily

Lena Mukhina air  raids  and  artillery  bombardment  of  residential neighbourhoods  drove  the  city's  inhabitants  into bomb shelters, several times a day, and for hours at a time. People's initial curiosity in the aftermath of the first bomb attacks soon gave way to fear and then, in conditions of appalling hunger and cold, to apathy. Leningraders welcomed inclement weather for the reduced visibility it brought. They came to dread sunny days and moonlit nights, when the Germans would be sure to bomb their city. Cloud cover,  however,  offered  no  protection from artillery fire: in just over six months from the start of the siege there were  only  thirty-two  days  when  shells did not explode on the city's streets.

Hunger soon set in. Between September and November 1941 the bread rations that had been announced in July were reduced five times, reaching their lowest point on 20 November  -  125 'blockade grams' for children, dependents and white-collar workers and 250g for manual workers, technicians and engineers.  Rations  of  meat,  butter,  sugar  and  other  food items  were  severely  reduced.  The  summer  months  and  the beginning  of  autumn,  when  it  was  still  possible  to  buy  food without ration cards in ordinary shops and canteens were no more than a distant memory.

## Q.1. Infer  the  meanings  of  the  following  expressions. The first has been done for you as an example.

## Reading CompRehension text ii

There  are  many  ways  of  recording  the  events,  news,  and personal experiences. Diary writing, logbook, daybook, journal, etc. are a few to name. The journal writing is about writing the everyday record of an event or writing about an event, activity or experience, etc.

The following is an excerpt from the beginning of A Journal of the Plague Year by Daniel Defoe.

## A Journal of the Plague Year

It  was about the beginning of September, 1664, that I, among the  rest  of  my  neighbours,  heard  in  ordinary  discourse  that the plague was returned again in Holland; for it had been very violent there, and particularly at Amsterdam and Rotterdam, in the year 1663, whither, they say, it was brought, some said from Italy,  others  from  the  Levant,  among  some  goods  which  were brought home by their Turkey fleet; others said it was brought from Candia; others from Cyprus. It mattered not from whence it came; but all agreed it was come into Holland again.

We had no such thing as printed newspapers in those days to spread rumours and reports of things, and to improve them by the invention of men, as I have lived to see practiced since. But  such  things  as  these  were  gathered  from  the  letters  of merchants and others who corresponded abroad, and from them were handed about by word of mouth only; so that things did not spread instantly over the whole nation, as they do now.

But it seems that the Government had a true account of it, and several councils were held about ways to prevent its coming over; but all was kept very private. Hence, it was that this rumour died off again, and people began to forget it as a thing we were very  little  concerned  in,  and  that  we  hoped  was  not  true;  till the latter end of November or the beginning of December 1664 when two men, said to be Frenchmen, died of the plague in Long Acre, or rather at the upper end of Drury Lane. The family they were in endeavoured to conceal it as much as possible, but as it had gotten some vent in the discourse of the neighbourhood, the  Secretaries  of  State  got  knowledge  of  it;  and  concerning themselves to inquire about it, in order to be certain of the truth, two physicians and a surgeon were ordered to go to the house

and make inspection. This they did; and finding evident tokens of the sickness upon both the bodies that were dead, they gave their opinions publicly that they died of the plague. Whereupon, it was given in to the parish clerk, and he also returned them to the Hall; and it was printed in the weekly bill of mortality in the usual manner, thus - Plague 2. Parishes infected 1.

2. (a)  Ask your teacher to recite the poem. Listen to the poem attentively and identify the qualities mentioned.
3. (b)  Discuss these qualities with your partner.
4. (c)  Think of a person who has some of these qualities and talk about them to your partner. You can highlight the incidents  and  actions  of  the  person  that  reflect  these qualities.

## Lena Mukhina's Diary 22 May 1941-25 May 1942

'Remember  My  Sad  Story:  Lena  Mukhina's  Siege Diary'

Consider  any  day  on  which  you  do  not  discover anything new or learn anything useful a lost day!

Anyone  can  become  strong,  smart  and  steadfast. There is only one essential requirement  -  will power!

Will power can conquer anything.

A strong-willed person is persistent and determined.

People are not born brave, strong and smart. These qualities must be acquired through perseverance and with determination, like the ability to read and write.

One of the three islands in the Juan Fernandez archipelago, 700 km off the Pacific coast of Chile was discovered in the 16th  century.  Alexander  Selkirk,  the  Scottish  sailor  was marooned there for four years and four months. He related his experience to Daniel Defoe, who wrote his famous adventure book Robinson Crusoe based on the sailor's experience, since then the island is known as Robinson Crusoe.

There is a seemingly unbelievable true story of the orphaned bear  cub,  which  was  found  by  Polish  troops  during  World War II who travelled with them through Iraq, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Italy and Scotland. During the war, Wojciech Narebski and his fellow Polish servicemen had to lift crates of heavy metal artillery. Fortunately for them, one of the soldiers had superhuman strength: Corporal Wojtek, a Syrian brown bear. When the bear saw that soldiers were struggling, he'd want to help... he'd come over, grab a crate and carry it to the truck. This can be heavy work, even for a bear. When Wojtek (bear) got tired, he would simply stack one crate on top of the other which also helped the soldiers because they didn't have to lift the crate off the ground. Of course, Corporal Wojtek (bear) got a reward of honey and marmalade. That was his favourite!

You know, things can happen that you wouldn't normally think are true. Collect some more stories under the title'Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.'
