Unit 8

## Let's Begin

1.   In the lesson 'The Sermon at Benaras' you were asked to find out the meaning of 'sermon'. The meanings are given below but these are in different contexts:
-  a talk on a religious or moral subject
-  a long or monotonous piece of admonition or caution or a warning, a lecture.
4. (a)  Discuss with your classmates the context to which the present text belongs.
5. (b) What  could  be  the  examples  for  the  different  context according to you?
6. (c)  When your parents or elders say something, you say, 'Oh, not again!' When do you say so and why?
2.   Read the poem given below in the context of 'The Sermon at Benaras'. It was actually delivered as a part of a sermon in 1910 by the author, Canon Henry Scott Holland (1847 -1918), a  priest  at  St.  Paul's  Cathedral,  London.  After  reading  the poem, discuss in groups of four and list the similarities and differences between 'The Sermon at Benaras' and 'Death Is Nothing  At  All'.  For  example  the  theme,  the  situation,  the philosophy of the two speakers etc.

## Death Is Nothing At All

Death is nothing at all. It does not count. I have only slipped away into the next room. Nothing has happened.

## Look Up and Understand

familiar fondly negligible parting solemnity

Everything remains exactly as it was.

I am I, and you are you, and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged.

Whatever we were to each other, that we are still.

Call me by the old familiar name. Speak of me in the easy way which you always used. Put no difference into your tone. Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.

Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together.

Play, smile, think of me, pray for me.

Let my name be ever the household word that it always was. Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it.

Life means all that it ever meant. It is the same as it ever was. There is absolute and unbroken continuity. What is this death but a negligible accident?

Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight? I am but waiting for you, for an interval, somewhere very near, just round the corner.

## All is well.

Nothing is hurt; nothing is lost.

One brief moment and all will be as it was before.

How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again!

Canon Henry Scott Holland

Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow.

In the future, if we want a happier humanity, a happy world, we must tackle the root of the problem. Of course the economy and political power are also causes. But the ultimate cause lies within the human mind. Every human action, verbal or physical,

# PAGE 3

even minor actions, have some motivation. Proper motivation or proper development is an important factor. Thus, if intelligence is accompanied with human affection and compassion, what I call human feeling, then it is very useful.

If society's moral values and standards of behaviour become negative, each of us will suffer. Therefore, the intentions of an individual are very much related to the interests of society. There is a definite correlation.

The educational system and family life are two very important areas.  In  the  educational  field,  one  has  to  take  care  not  only of  the  brain,  but  also  of  one's  spiritual  development.  I  say 'spiritual development' not in a religious sense but simply in the sense of having a good and compassionate heart. If one has a compassionate heart, it automatically brings inner strength and allows for less fear and less doubt. Subsequently, one becomes happier and more open-minded, thus making more friends in society.

(Source: The Transformed Mind by His Holiness the Dalai Lama)

Read the poem given below and answer the questions that follow.

Father  Gilligan  was  overworked  and  extremely  tired  as  he kept attending to the sick and dying among his parishioners. He was offering them spiritual comfort day and night. One night he fell asleep on a chair. God sent his angel down to help his most beloved servant of the people.

## The Ballad of Father Gilligan

The old priest Peter Gilligan Was weary night and day, For half his flock were in their beds, Or under green sods lay.

Once while he nodded on a chair, At the moth  -  hour of eve, Another poor man sent for him, And he began to grieve.

# PAGE 5

'I have no rest, nor joy, nor peace, For people die and die;' And after cried he, 'God forgive! My body spake, not I!'

And then, half-lying on the chair, He knelt, prayed, fell asleep; And the moth-hour went from the fields, And stars began to peep.

They slowly into millions grew, And leaves shook in the wind; And God covered the world with shade, And whispered to mankind.

Upon the time of sparrow chirp When the moths came once more, The old priest Peter Gilligan Stood upright on the floor.

'Mavrone, Mavrone! The man has died, While I slept on the chair,' He roused his horse out of its sleep And rode with little care.

He rode now as he never rode, By rocky lane and fen; The sick man's wife opened the door: 'Father! You come again!'

'And is the poor man dead?' he cried. 'He died an hour ago.' The old priest Peter Gilligan In grief swayed to and fro.

'When you were gone he turned and died, As merry as a bird.' The old priest Peter Gilligan He knelt him at that word.

'He who hath made the night of stars For souls who tire and bleed, Sent one of His great angles down To help me in my need.

## Reported Speech

We  use  direct  speech  when  we  repeat  someone's  words  and indirect  speech  when  we  use  our  own  words  to  report  what someone else has said. We use an appropriate reporting verb, make  pronominal  (relating  to  pronouns)  changes  and  change certain  words  denoting  'nearness'  in  the  direct  form  to  words suggesting 'remoteness' (in time and place) in the indirect form.

## For example

- (a)  Riki said, 'I'm hungry.'
- (b) Riki said that he was hungry.
- (c)  Alexa said to Meena, 'Have you visited your home town Puducherry?'
- (d)  Alexa asked Meena  if she had  visited  her  home  town Puducherry.

In the sentences 'b' and 'd'  there are changes of person (I-he, Meena-you-she,  your-her).  The  reporting  verb  'said'  has  been changed to 'asked'.

Some of the reporting verbs are: tell, ask, reply, warn, say, report, answer, explain, exclaim, mention, promise, suggest, order, etc. Example

- (a)  The doctor said to me, 'Drink eight glasses of water to avoid acidity.'
- (b) The  doctor  told  me  to  drink  eight  glasses  of  water  to avoid acidity.
- (c)  'Please don't tell anybody about my illness', Amita said to me.
- (d)  Amita asked me not to tell anyone about her illness.

It is said, 'It is not how much we have, but how much we enjoy that makes happiness.'

Being happy does not require everything to be good but an eye to see good in everything. One day a crow saw a swan. 'This swan is so white,' he thought, 'and I am so black. This swan must be the happiest bird in the world.'

The swan replied, 'I was feeling that I was the happiest bird around. But I think the parrot is the happiest bird as it has two colours.' The crow then approached the parrot. The parrot said, 'I have only two colours, but the peacock has multiple colours.'

The crow then visited a peacock in the zoo. 'Dear peacock,' the crow said, 'you are so beautiful. Every day, thousands of people come to see you. You are the happiest bird on the planet.'

The peacock said, 'I always thought that I was the most beautiful and happy bird on the planet. But I am entrapped in this zoo. I have realised that the crow is the only bird not kept in a cage, and could happily roam everywhere.'

refused to give it. He said that belonged to him because he had saved its life. It did not belong to Devadutta who had tried to kill.

## ListeninG

1.  Following is a narrative on Sanchi stupa.  Listen to it carefully and answer the questions that follow. You can listen to the recorded narrative or ask your teacher, sibling or friend to read it aloud.

The  fascinating  and  world famous  Sanchi  stupa  is located  on  a  hilltop  in Sanchi town, Madhya Pradesh, India. It is one of  the  most  important Buddhist monuments that  portrays  Buddhist art and sculpture. Starting  from  the  third century BC through the twelfth century AD, it

![Image](outputs/jewe208/jewe208_artifacts/image_000015_2ec37dd8becda89fb44c006bb1199cc10aff606acea2ade4a1f669f79abc0339.png)

attracts the attention of thousands of visitors round the year including national and foreign tourists, archaeologists, and historians among others.

This stupa is the oldest stone structure in India that was built  during  the  Mauryan  period.  Originally  commissioned in  the  third  century  BCE  by  Emperor  Ashoka,  this  huge hemispherical dome consists of a central chamber. In this chamber, the relics of Lord Buddha are placed. The original construction work of this stupa was supervised by Ashoka. His  wife,  Devi,  was  the  daughter  of  a  merchant  of  nearby village, Vidisha. Sanchi was also her birthplace as well as the venue of her and Ashoka's wedding. Later, four ornamental gateways or toranas facing four directions and a balustrade surrounding  the  stupa  were  added  in  the  first  century BCE. The Great stupa at Sanchi is one of the oldest stone structures in India and counted among the best conserved ancient stupas of Central India. It has been enlisted as an UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1989.

The  sculptures  on  the  ornamental  gateways  or toranas consist of decorative illustrations of events encompassing the life of Lord Buddha. These events are explained in the Jataka tales. The tree used here symbolises Lord Buddha. The most striking features regarding the stupa is that Lord Buddha has been depicted symbolically by figures like thrones, wheels, and footprints among others.
