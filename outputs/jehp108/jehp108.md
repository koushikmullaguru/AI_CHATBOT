Adolescents in different situations experience a wide range of emotions that could vary from positive to negative, such as, happiness, satisfaction, sadness, anger, frustration, etc. They have high expectations from themselves that may be further reinforced by people and environment around them. This may cause stress in them. There are many occasions when  they  may  get  stressed  or  feel  angry  or  frustrated. It  is  natural  for  adolescents  to  experience  both  positive and negative emotions. It is also necessary to express their feelings and emotions. There are positive and negative ways of  expressing the emotions. It is pointed out that negative emotions  and  their  expression  in  negative  ways  may  be caused by certain stresses experienced by the adolescents.

In today's life, stress is becoming a major cause of many health-related problems. It is a known fact that chronic stress negatively  affects  health.  Hypertension,  diabetes  mellitus, cardiac  problems,  depression,  anxiety  attacks,  road-rage, etc., have become common now-a-days. The most common emotion faced by all of us during this COVID-19 pandemic is fear. It has also made us panicky and anxious to deal with such issues.  Yoga  can  help  us  in  dealing  with  stress  and mental health issue during this time. In the management of stress, lifestyle  plays  an  important role. A healthy lifestyle reduces stress and promotes one's health.

Here,  it  is  important  to  recognise  that  stress  can  be tackled and definitely decreased. Many times, we may not necessarily be in control of the situations but we can control our over-all response to such situations.

## What is stress?

Stress  can  be  understood  as  a  state  of  physiological  and psychological imbalance resulting from demanding or difficult situations which the person is not able to cope with.

## Activity 8.1

Think and discuss the following with your friends:

## Questions

- Have you ever experienced stress?
- What was the cause of it?
- How did you manage it?
- Can you think any other way by which you could have better managed it?

In day-to-day life, a person faces many situations. Some situations  are  easy  to  handle;  while  some  are  difficult. As  a  result,  the  body  starts  responding  at  physiological  and psychological levels. At the physiological level, there may be changes in heart rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, secretions of  hormones, etc.  At  the  psychological  level,  there  may  be changes in attention, concentration, memory and alertness and  also  in  the  emotional  state  (like  anger,  fear,  hate, sadness, etc.).

Stress  generally  occurs  as  a  result  of  major  events  in life,  such  as,  tough  competitions,  getting  low  scores  in  an examination, recent break-up in friendship, not getting a good job, a fight with others, and so on. There are several  other factors which may cause stress in a person, like, diseases, poor  living  conditions,  poverty,  problems  in  relationship, challenges  of  adolescence,  wrong  habits,  high  aspirations, unrealistic  goals,  death  of  a  close  relative,  discrimination, fast changing life and many others. However, sometimes it may also occur due to minor issues, such as, not getting up early,  not  getting  ready  on  time,  reaching  school  late,  not getting the desired food, arguments with a friend, not getting permission from parents for attending a late night party, and so on.

Intensity  of  stress  varies  from  person  to  person  and generally depends on perception of a particular situation by that person. A situation may be easy to handle for one person, while it may pose a big challenge to another. For example, examination may cause stress in one student, while it may not affect another student.

Stress which motivates us to perform better and learn new skills is beneficial. For example, getting admission in a new course, preparing for an examination or getting promotion may cause stress  but  this  stress  is  beneficial  as  it  finally contributes towards growth and development. Stress may be harmful also. When stress is severe and chronic it reduces efficiency of a person. This kind of stress may adversely affect our ability to feel, think and act.

During  severe  stress,  people  may  become  restless  and worried. They may not remember the things properly. Even small  things  may  make  them  angry.  You  also  might  have observed that when you are in tension you become restless. You  may  not  be  able  to  focus  on  your  studies  and  small things may cause irritation.

Chronic and severe stress reduces our body's ability to  fight  diseases.  It  can  lead  to  various  psychosomatic diseases, such as, peptic ulcer, migraine, diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, etc. It could even result in heart attack, brain stroke and death. Several psychological disorders, such as, anxiety attacks and depression may

also result from chronic and severe stress. However, the fact is - we cannot avoid stress. Therefore, management of stress is necessary

## Yoga as a WaY of Life for stress

## ManageMent

Yoga has been considered a panacea for managing the stress. In this context, we will discuss the role of  yoga in developing a  healthy  lifestyle  by  which  stress  can  be  managed.  Yoga practices when become a way of life, play an important role in stress management.

You have learnt about asana , pranayama , kriya , mudra , bandha and  meditation  in  Class  IX.  However,  yoga  is  not limited  to  the  physical  postures,  breathing  techniques  or meditation for a few minutes only. Rather yoga is a way of life also. It propounds several principles and practices, such as, asana, pranayama, kriya, mudra, bandha and meditation which  are  relevant  to  healthy  living.  Yogic  principles  and practices of healthy living can be adopted by all, irrespective of age, gender, profession or place. As a way of life, yoga gives direction  about  food,  eating  habits,  thinking,  recreational means  and  conduct.  Yogic  way  of  life,  if  adopted  in  true sense, empowers us to deal with stress and promote physical and mental health.

The components of yogic way of life are -

- Ahara (Food)
- Vihara (Relaxation)
- Achara (Conduct)
- Vichara (Thinking)
- Vyavahara (Behaviour or actions)

## Ahara

The  principles  of ahara are  related  to  food  consumption. Yoga  emphasises  on mitahara, which  is  related  to  quality and quantity of food and also the state of mind during the intake of food.

As for the quality, the concept of mitahara implies that food  should  be  freshly  cooked,  nutritious,  nourishing  and in  the  natural  form.  Regarding  quantity  of  food, mitahara mentions  that  two  quarters  of  the  stomach  should  be filled  with  food,  one  quarter  with  liquid  and  the  remaining quarter (one-fourth) should be left empty for free flow of air. This implies that quantity of food may vary from person to person  depending  upon  the  individual  requirements.  It  is very  natural  that  a  sportsperson  will  require  more  food  as compared to a person who is doing desk job. Mitahara also advocates that the food should be eaten with positive state of

## Activity 8.2

In Column I, put a list of food items that you like eating and in Column II put the food items that you consider good for your health.

| Column I                        | Column II                                    |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Food items that you like eating | Food items that you consider good for health |

## Questions

- Compare the items of both the columns. Do the items in Column I tally with those in Column II?
- Do you think that you need to change your food habits? Make a separate list indicating which food items from the list (Column I) you want to change.

## Vihara

Vihara means  relaxation,  which  can  be  brought  about by  activities,  such  as,  exercise,  recreational  and  creative activities like drawing, painting, singing, etc. These activities help to regulate and channelise our emotions and bring us joy and happiness. Yogic practices of asana, pranayama and meditation relax body and mind. In addition to this, relaxation can be attained in good company also. Sound sleep is also important for relaxation. It is, therefore, important that we should regularly follow a timetable that provides adequate time for yogic and creative activities which are relaxing.

| Time allocated                                                            | Activities                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| • 5.30 to 6.30 pm • _________________________ • _________________________ | • Yogasana • _________________________ • _________________________ |

mind with utmost concentration. You might have observed if someone eats while watching the television or in an angry mood or when the person's attention is somewhere else, then they tend to just gulp down the food without enjoying it. So, the state of mind is also very important while eating. Thus, mitahara emphasises that right quality and quantity of food should be eaten in a positive state of mind.

# PAGE 5

## Achara

Achara means  conduct  that  includes  emotions,  attitudes, desires, instincts and habits. Right conduct is essential for a  stress-free  life.  Positive  emotions  and  positive  attitudes, good habits and control on desires help in making us strong, both, individually and socially. The right conduct protects us from unnecessary stress caused by negative emotions and attitudes like hate, jealousy, fear, etc.

Therefore, we should have control on our desires, instincts, emotions, habits and attitudes. Here, yoga is important as it encourages good conduct in our personal and social life. Yoga advocates for  positive  emotions  and  positive  attitude towards self and other persons.

In  this  context  yogic  principles  of Yama (restraint)  and Niyama (observance) help to develop control on our desires and emotions and bring about peace and harmony.

## Yama (Restraint) and Niyama (Observance)

Yamas (restraints)  and Niyamas (observances) are sets of the dos  and  the  don'ts.  They  can  be  considered  as  the  universal codes of conduct that help us in following high standards in our personal and social life. Yamas are  concerned with one's social life; while the niyamas are concerned with one's personal life. Yama and Niyama are part of Ashtanga Yoga that has been propagated by Patanjali.

The five yamas are ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truthfulness), asteya (non  stealing), brahmcharya (celibacy) and aparigraha (non possessiveness).

The five niyamas are: Shaucha (cleanliness), Santosha (contentment), Tapas (austerity), Swadhyaya (self  study)  and Ishwarpranidhana (surrender to god).

## Vichara

We know that thoughts are very important as our behaviour is guided by the kind of thoughts we have. Our thinking should be positive.

Positive thoughts bring pleasure to our life; while negative thoughts can make us unhappy. Right thinking guides us towards appropriate behaviour. It helps in prevention and management of stress-related health problems.

Yoga prescribes that one should have positive thoughts. Positive  thoughts  give  us  strength  to  bear  the  sorrows  of life. Yogic practices like yama, niyama, pratyahara, dhyana (meditation),  study  of  good  literature,  etc.,  help  us  in controlling  our  thoughts  and  thereby  promoting  optimism in life.

Shreya is an outgoing and independent girl. She does not like to be dictated by her  parents.  Her  parents are worried as they think that she has been wasting her  time  and  energy  on futile,  trivial  and  useless things. One day, her parents asked her to study  while  she  wanted to  finish  the  novel  which she was reading.  At this, Shreya  lost  her  temper and  started  shouting  at her parents.

## Questions

- Was Shreya's behaviour towards her parents appropriate?
- Were  her  attitude  and thinking responsible for this kind of behaviour?

## Vyavahara

Vyavahara (behaviour)  means  actions. Vyavahara is  the result of ahara , vihara, achara and vichara . Yogic philosophy propounds that our actions should be right. We should not indulge  in  wrong  activities.  Our  behaviour  towards  others should be appropriate. Karma- yoga proposes that we should perform right and act with full dedication and to our utmost capacity without worrying about the results. We can remain stress-free and be happy if we follow this philosophy and act accordingly.

## Yogic Practices

The practices which can strengthen the autonomic nervous system  with  the  dominance  of  para-sympathetic  system of  body  are  beneficial  for  managing  stress.  Here  are  some asanas , pranayamas , kriya and relaxing practices which are helpful in stress management.

## Yoganidra

Yoganidra means  'sleep'  with  awareness. Yoganidra is  a state of mind between wakefulness and dream. Normally, we sleep  without    awareness.  But  in yoganidra we sleep with awareness. Yoganidra is helpful in management of stress. It relaxes body and mind and reduces tension.

Yoganidra is practised in Shavasana . It consists of body and  breath  awareness.  The  awareness  is  rotated  in  quick succession through all parts of the body, then it is taken to the breath and finally to the mind.

Fig. 8.22: Shavasana

![Image](outputs/jehp108/jehp108_artifacts/image_000044_5480de5e657566b11562ddd4d91ad973baad6f1b8c82b58d1110725a32e4d099.png)

Let us practise Yoganidra by following the steps given below. Lie supine  in Shavasana . Take  deep  breath  and  feel completely relaxed.

## Phase 1: Awareness of the body

Rotate your awareness to different parts of the body as per the instructions give below:

- Relax the first (big), second, third, fourth, fifth toe of the right foot, sole, heel, ankles, calf muscles, knee, thigh and  right  hip.  Similarly  relax  the  first  (big),  second, third, fourth, fifth toe of the left foot, sole, heel, ankles, calf muscles, knee, thigh and left hip.

## Phase 2: Awareness of the breath

- Now  focus  your  attention  on  breath.  Feel  the  flow of  your  natural  breath.  Do  not  change  it.  Feel  the movement  of  nostrils  with  each  breath.  Now  focus your  attention  on  the  movements  of  the  abdominal area  during  breathing.  Abdomen  falls  and  rises  with each  exhalation  and  inhalation.  Continue  focussing your attention on breathing and the movement of the abdomen.

## Phase 3: Coming back

- To come back, become aware of your body and be aware of the time and place you are in. Move your fingers and toes;  and  move  the  head  from  one  side  to  the  other. Take your own time. Be wide awake. Slowly sit up and open your eyes.

Note:  After  breath  awareness  a  scene  may  be  described  and the practitioner is asked to visualise it in that state. Alternately, different things like floating in a swimming pool, sitting in a garden, burning a candle, chirping birds, mountains, flowers, rising sun, a  song,  etc.,  can  be  suggested  and  the  practitioner  is  asked  to develop vision on thinking, feeling and at an emotional level. After this, a resolution also can be made. For making a resolution, before the stage of body awareness, they are asked to think about what they want to pursue. Now the resolution is repeated three times. After this, the person is asked to come back by following the steps as mentioned in the 'come back' phase.
