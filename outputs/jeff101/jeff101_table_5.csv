WHAT WE HAVE DONE
• Introduced students to the story that they are going to read.
• Related a thought-provoking story about the nature of belief.
"• Helped students, through an interesting activity, to understand something that happens in the story - how to send money using a money order."
"• Guided them through the reading activity by providing periodic comprehension checks as they read, and checked for holistic understanding at the end of the reading activity."
"• Provided interesting exercises to strengthen students' grasp of the specific vocabulary found in the story, and also introduced them to related vocabulary."
