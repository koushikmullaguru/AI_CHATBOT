E lectricity has an important place in modern society. It is a controllable and convenient form of energy for a variety of uses in homes, schools, hospitals, industries and so on. What constitutes electricity? How does it flow in an electric circuit? What are the factors that control or regulate the current through an electric circuit? In this Chapter, we shall attempt to answer such questions. We shall also discuss the heating effect of electric current and its applications.

## 11.1  ELECTRIC  CURRENT  AND  CIRCUIT 11.1  ELECTRIC  CURRENT  AND  CIRCUIT

We are familiar with air current and water current. We know that flowing water constitute water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric charge flows through a conductor (for example, through a metallic wire), we say that there is an electric current in the conductor. In a torch, we know that the cells (or a battery, when placed in proper order) provide flow of charges or an electric current through the torch bulb to glow. We have also seen that the torch gives light only when its switch is on . What does a switch do? A switch makes a conducting link between the cell and the bulb. A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an electric circuit. Now, if the circuit is broken anywhere (or the switch of the torch is turned off ), the current stops flowing and the bulb does not glow.

How do we express electric current? Electric current is expressed by the amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. In other words, it is the rate of flow of electric charges. In circuits using metallic wires, electrons constitute the flow of charges. However, electrons were not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first observed. So, electric current was considered to be the flow of positive charges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the direction of electric current. Conventionally, in an electric circuit the direction of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the flow of electrons, which are negative charges.

The SI unit of electric charge is coulomb (C), which is equivalent to the charge contained in nearly 6 × 10 18  electrons. (We know that an electron  possesses  a  negative  charge  of  1.6  ×  10 -19 C.)  The  electric current is  expressed  by  a  unit  called  ampere  (A),  named  after  the French scientist, Andre-Marie Ampere (1775-1836). One ampere is constituted by the flow of one coulomb of charge per second, that is, 1 A = 1 C/1 s. Small quantities of current are expressed in milliampere

(1 mA = 10 -3  A) or in microampere (1 µ A = 10 -6 A). An instrument called ammeter measures electric current in a circuit. It is always connected in series in  a  circuit  through  which  the  current  is  to  be measured.  Figure  11.1  shows  the  schematic diagram of a typical electric circuit comprising a cell, an electric bulb, an ammeter and a plug key. Note that the electric current flows in the circuit from the positive terminal of the cell to the negative terminal of the cell through the bulb and ammeter.

## 11.2  ELECTRIC  POTENTIAL  AND  POTENTIAL  DIFFERENCE 11.2  ELECTRIC  POTENTIAL  AND  POTENTIAL  DIFFERENCE

What makes the electric charge to flow? Let us consider the analogy of flow of water. Charges do not flow in a copper wire by themselves, just as water in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tube is connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a pressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of the other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic wire, the gravity, of course, has no role to play; the electrons move only if  there is a difference of electric pressure - called the potential difference -along the conductor. This difference of potential may be produced by a battery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within a cell generates the potential difference across the terminals of the cell, even when no current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a conducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in motion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order to maintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its chemical energy stored in it.

We define the electric potential difference between two points in an electric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit charge from one point to the other -

Potential difference ( V )  between two points = Work done ( W )/Charge ( Q ) V = W/Q (11.2)

The SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after Alessandro Volta (1745-1827), an Italian physicist. One volt is the potential difference between two points in a current carrying conductor when 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb from one point to the other.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The potential difference is measured by means of an instrument called the voltmeter. The voltmeter is always connected in parallel across the points between which the potential difference is to be measured.

## Example 11.2

How much work is done in moving a charge of 2 C across two points having a potential difference 12 V?

## Solution

The amount of charge Q, that flows between two points at potential difference V (= 12 V) is 2 C. Thus, the amount of work W, done in moving the charge [from Eq. (11.2)] is

W =

VQ

= 12 V × 2 C

= 24 J.

It is often convenient to draw a schematic diagram, in which different components of the circuit are represented by the symbols conveniently used.

V-I  graph  for  a  nichrome  wire.  A straight line plot shows that as the current through a wire increases, the potential  difference  across  the  wire increases linearly - this is Ohm's law.

In this Activity, you will find that approximately the same value for V/I is obtained in each case. Thus the V-I graph is a straight line that passes through the origin of the graph, as shown in Fig. 11.3. Thus, V/I is a constant ratio.

In  1827,  a  German  physicist  Georg  Simon  Ohm (1787-1854) found out the relationship between the current I, flowing in a metallic wire and the potential difference across its terminals. The potential difference, V , across the ends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly proportional to the current flowing through it,  provided its temperature remains the same. This is called Ohm's law. In other words -

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

In Eq. (11.4), R is a constant for the given metallic wire at a given temperature and is called its resistance. It is the property of a conductor to resist the flow of charges  through it. Its SI unit is ohm, represented by the Greek letter Ω . According to Ohm's law,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

If the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is 1 V and the current through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the conductor

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

It is obvious from Eq. (11.7) that the current through a resistor is inversely proportional to its resistance. If the resistance is doubled the current gets halved. In many practical cases it is necessary to increase or decrease the current in an electric circuit. A component used to regulate current without changing the voltage source is called variable resistance. In an electric circuit, a device called rheostat is often used to change the resistance in the circuit. We will now study about electrical resistance of a conductor with the help of following Activity.

## Activity  11.2 Activity  11.2

- /square6 Take a nichrome wire, a torch bulb, a 10 W bulb and an ammeter (0 - 5 A range), a plug key and some connecting wires.
- /square6 Set up the circuit by connecting four dry cells of 1.5 V each in series with the ammeter leaving a gap XY in the circuit, as shown in Fig. 11.4.

In this Activity we observe that the current is different for different components. Why do they differ? Certain components offer an easy path for the flow of electric current while the others resist the flow. We know that motion of electrons in an electric circuit constitutes an electric current. The electrons, however, are not completely free to move within a conductor. They are restrained by the attraction of the atoms among which they move. Thus, motion of electrons through a conductor is retarded by its resistance. A component of a given size that offers a low resistance is a good conductor. A conductor having some appreciable resistance is called a resistor. A component of identical size that offers a higher resistance is a poor conductor. An insulator of the same size offers even higher resistance.

- /square6 Now, plug the key. Note the current in the ammeter.
- /square6 Replace  the  nichrome  wire  by  another  nichrome  wire  of  same  thickness  but  twice  the length, that is 2 l [marked (2) in the Fig. 11.5].
- /square6 Note the ammeter reading.
- /square6 Now replace the wire by a thicker nichrome wire, of the same length l [marked  (3)].  A thicker  wire  has  a  larger  cross-sectional  area.  Again  note  down  the  current  through  the circuit.
- /square6 Instead of taking a nichrome wire, connect a copper wire [marked (4) in Fig. 11.5] in the circuit.  Let  the  wire  be  of  the  same  length  and  same  area  of  cross-section  as  that  of  the first nichrome wire [marked (1)]. Note the value of the current.
- /square6 Notice the difference in the current in all cases.
- /square6 Does the current depend on the length of the conductor?
- /square6 Does the current depend on the area of cross-section of the wire used?

It is observed that the ammeter reading decreases to one-half when the length of the wire is doubled. The ammeter reading is increased when a thicker wire of the same material and of the same length is used in the circuit. A change in ammeter reading is observed when a wire of different material of the same length and the same area of cross-section is used. On applying Ohm's law [Eqs. (11.5) - (11.7)], we observe that the resistance of the conductor depends (i) on its length, (ii) on its area of cross-section, and (iii) on the nature of its material. Precise measurements have shown that resistance of a uniform metallic conductor is directly proportional to its length ( l ) and inversely proportional to the area of cross-section ( A ). That is,

where ρ (rho) is a constant of proportionality and is called the electrical resistivity of the material of the conductor. The SI unit of resistivity is Ω m. It is a characteristic property of the material. The metals and alloys

# PAGE 9

have very low resistivity in the  range of 10 -8 Ω m to  10 -6 Ω m. They are good conductors of electricity. Insulators like rubber and glass have resistivity of the order of 10 12  to 10 17 Ω m. Both the resistance and resistivity of a material vary with temperature.

Table 11.2 reveals that the resistivity of an alloy is generally higher than that of its constituent metals. Alloys do not oxidise (burn) readily at  high  temperatures. For this reason, they are commonly used in electrical heating devices, like electric iron, toasters etc. Tungsten is used almost exclusively for filaments of electric bulbs, whereas copper and aluminium are generally used for electrical transmission lines.

## Solution

- (a) We are given V = 220 V; R = 1200 Ω
- From Eq. (12.6), we have the current I = 220 V/1200 (b) We are given, V = 220 V, R = 100 Ω .
- . Ω = 0.18 A.

From Eq. (11.6), we have the current I = 220 V/100 Ω = 2.2 A. Note the difference of current drawn by an electric bulb and electric heater from the same 220 V source!

Resistance of a metal wire of length 1 m is 26 Ω at 20°C. If the diameter of the wire is 0.3 mm, what will be the resistivity of the metal at that temperature? Using Table 11.2, predict the material of the wire.

## Solution

We are given the resistance R of  the  wire  =  26 Ω ,  the  diameter d = 0.3 mm = 3 × 10 -4  m, and the length l of the wire = 1 m.

## 11.6  RESIST 11.6  RESISTANCE  OF  A  SYSTEM  OF  RESISTORS ANCE  OF  A  SYSTEM  OF  RESISTORS

In preceding sections, we learnt about some simple electric circuits. We have noticed how the current through a conductor depends upon its resistance and the potential difference across its ends. In various electrical gadgets, we often use resistors in various combinations. We now therefore intend to see how Ohm's law can be applied to combinations of resistors.

There are two methods of joining the resistors together. Figure 11.6 shows an electric circuit in which three resistors having resistances R 1 , R2 and R 3 , respectively, are joined end to end. Here the resistors are said to be connected in series.

What happens to the value of current when a number of resistors are connected in series  in  a  circuit?  What  would  be  their  equivalent resistance? Let us try to understand these with the help of the following activities.

- /square6 Join  three  resistors  of  different  values  in  series.  Connect  them with a battery, an ammeter and a plug key, as shown in Fig. 11.6. You may use the resistors of values like 1 Ω , 2 Ω , 3 Ω etc., and a battery of 6 V for performing this Activity.
- /square6 Plug the key. Note the ammeter reading.
- /square6 Change the  position  of  ammeter  to  anywhere  in  between  the resistors.  Note  the  ammeter  reading  each  time.
- /square6 Do  you  find  any  change  in  the  value  of  current  through  the ammeter?

You will observe that the value of the current in the ammeter is the same, independent of its position in the electric circuit. It means that in a series combination of resistors the current is the same in every part of the circuit or the same current through each resistor.

## Activity  11.5 Activity  11.5

- /square6 In Activity 11.4, insert a voltmeter across the ends X and Y of the series combination of three resistors, as shown in Fig. 11.6.
- /square6 Plug  the  key  in  the  circuit  and  note  the  voltmeter  reading.  It gives  the  potential  difference  across  the  series  combination  of resistors. Let it be V . Now measure the potential difference across the two terminals of the battery. Compare the two values.
- /square6 Take out the plug key and disconnect the voltmeter. Now insert the  voltmeter  across  the  ends  X  and  P  of  the  first  resistor,  as shown in Fig. 11.8.
- /square6 Plug the key and measure the potential difference across the first resistor. Let it be V 1 .
- /square6 Similarly,  measure  the  potential  difference  across  the  other  two resistors, separately. Let these values be V 2 and V 3 ,  respectively.
- /square6 Deduce a relationship between V , V 1 , V 2 and V 3 .

You will observe that the potential difference V is equal to the sum of potential differences V 1 , V 2 , and V 3 . That is the total potential difference across a combination of resistors in series is equal to the sum of potential difference across the individual resistors. That is,

In the electric circuit shown in Fig. 11.8, let I be the current through the circuit. The current through each resistor is also I . It is possible to replace the three resistors joined in series by an equivalent single resistor of resistance R , such that the potential difference V across it, and the current I through the circuit remains the same. Applying the Ohm's law to the entire circuit, we have

V = I R

We can conclude that when several resistors are joined in series, the resistance of the combination Rs equals the sum of their individual resistances, R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , and is thus greater than any individual resistance.

## Example 11.7

An electric lamp, whose resistance is 20 Ω , and a conductor of 4 Ω resistance are connected to a 6 V battery (Fig. 11.9). Calculate (a) the total resistance of the circuit, (b) the current through the circuit, and (c) the potential difference across the electric lamp and conductor.

## Solution

The resistance of electric lamp, R1 = 20 Ω ,

The resistance of the conductor connected in series, R 2 = 4 Ω .

Then the total resistance in the circuit

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The total potential difference across the two terminals of the battery V = 6 V.

Now by Ohm's law, the current through the circuit is given by

I = V / R s

- = 6 V/24 Ω
- = 0.25 A.

and,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Suppose that we like to replace the series combination of electric lamp and conductor by a single and equivalent resistor. Its resistance must be such that a potential difference of 6 V across the battery terminals will cause a current of 0.25 A in the circuit. The resistance R of this equivalent resistor would be

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

This is the total resistance of the series circuit; it is equal to the sum of the two resistances.

## Q U E S T I O N S

1. Draw a schematic diagram of a circuit consisting of a battery of three cells of 2 V each, a 5 Ω resistor, an 8 Ω resistor, and a 12 Ω resistor, and a plug key, all connected in series.
2. Redraw the circuit  of  Question  1,  putting  in  an  ammeter  to  measure the  current  through  the  resistors  and  a  voltmeter  to  measure  the potential difference across the 12 Ω resistor. What would be the readings in  the  ammeter and the voltmeter?

## 11.6.2 Resistors in Parallel

Now, let us consider the arrangement of three resistors joined in parallel with a combination of cells (or a battery), as shown in Fig.11.7.

## Activity  11.6 Activity  11.6

- /square6 Make a parallel  combination,  XY,  of  three resistors  having  resistances R 1 , R 2 ,  and R 3 , respectively.  Connect  it  with  a  battery,  a plug  key  and  an  ammeter,  as  shown  in Fig.  11.10.  Also  connect  a  voltmeter  in parallel  with  the  combination  of  resistors.
- /square6 Plug the key and note the ammeter reading. Let the current be I . Also take the voltmeter reading.  It  gives  the  potential  difference V, across  the  combination.  The  potential difference across each resistor is also V . This can be checked by connecting the voltmeter across  each  individual  resistor (see Fig. 11.11).

- /square6 Take out the plug from the key. Remove the ammeter and voltmeter from the circuit. Insert the ammeter in series with the resistor R 1 , as shown in Fig. 11.11. Note the ammeter reading, I 1 .
- /square6 Similarly,  measure  the  currents  through R 2 and R 3 .  Let  these  be I 2 and I 3 ,  respectively. What is the relationship between I , I 1 , I 2 and I 3 ?

It is observed that the total current I , is equal to the sum of the separate currents through each branch of the combination.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

From Eqs. (11.15) to (11.17), we have

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Thus, we may conclude that the reciprocal of the equivalent resistance of a group of resistances joined in parallel is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances.

## Example 11.8

In the circuit diagram given in Fig. 11.10, suppose the resistors R 1 , R2 and R3 have the values 5 Ω , 10 Ω , 30 Ω , respectively, which have been connected to a battery of 12 V. Calculate (a) the current through each resistor, (b) the total current in the circuit, and (c) the total circuit resistance.

## Solution

R 1 = 5 Ω , R 2 = 10 Ω , and R 3 = 30 Ω .

Potential difference across the battery, V = 12 V.

This is also the potential difference across each of the individual resistor; therefore, to calculate the current in the resistors, we use Ohm's law.

The current I 1 , through R 1 = V/ R 1

The total current in the circuit,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The total resistance R p , is given by [Eq. (11.18)]

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Thus, R p = 3 Ω .

## Example 11.9

If in Fig. 11.12, R1 = 10 Ω , R2 = 40 Ω , R3 = 30 Ω , R 4 = 20 Ω , R5 = 60 Ω , and a 12 V battery is connected to the arrangement. Calculate (a) the total resistance in the circuit, and (b) the total current flowing in the circuit.

## Solution

Suppose we replace the parallel resistors R1 and R2 by an equivalent resistor of resistance, R ′ . Similarly we replace the parallel resistors R 3 , R 4 and R 5 by an equivalent single resistor of resistance R ″ . Then using Eq. (11.18), we have

1/ R ′ = 1/10 + 1/40 = 5/40; that is R ′ = 8 Ω . Similarly, 1/ R ″ = 1/30 + 1/20 + 1/60 = 6/60; that is, R ″ = 10 Ω . ′ ″ Ω.

Thus, the total resistance, R = R + R = 18 To calculate the current, we use Ohm's law, and get I = V/R = 12 V/18 Ω = 0.67 A.

We have seen that in a series  circuit  the  current  is  constant throughout the electric circuit. Thus it is obviously impracticable to connect an electric bulb and an electric heater in series, because they need currents of widely different values to operate properly (see Example 11.3). Another major disadvantage of a series circuit is that when one component fails the circuit is broken and none of the components works. If  you  have used 'fairy lights' to decorate buildings on festivals, on marriage celebrations etc., you might have seen the electrician spending lot of time in trouble-locating and replacing the 'dead' bulb - each has to be tested to find which has fused or gone. On the other hand, a parallel circuit divides the current through the electrical gadgets. The total resistance in a parallel circuit is decreased as per Eq. (11.18). This is helpful  particularly  when  each  gadget  has  different  resistance  and requires different current to operate properly.

## 11.7  HEA 11.7  HEATING  EFFECT  OF  ELECTRIC  CURRENT TING  EFFECT  OF  ELECTRIC  CURRENT

We know that a battery or a cell is a source of electrical energy. The chemical reaction within the cell generates the potential difference between its two terminals that sets the electrons in motion to flow the current through a resistor or a system of resistors connected to the battery. We have also seen, in Section 11.2, that to maintain the current, the source has to keep expending its energy. Where does this energy go? A part of the source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed into useful work (like in rotating the blades of an electric fan). Rest of the source energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature of gadget. We often observe this in our everyday life. For example, an electric fan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other hand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration of resistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually gets dissipated entirely in the form of heat. This is known as the heating effect of electric current. This effect is utilised in devices such as electric heater, electric iron etc.

Consider a current I flowing through a resistor of resistance R . Let the potential difference across it be V (Fig. 11.13). Let t be the time during which a charge Q flows across. The work done in moving the charge Q through a potential difference V is VQ . Therefore, the source must supply energy equal to VQ in time t. Hence the power input to the circuit by the source is

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Or the energy supplied to the circuit by the source in time t is P × t , that is, VIt. What happens to this energy expended by the source? This energy  gets  dissipated  in  the  resistor  as  heat.  Thus  for  a  steady current I , the amount of heat H produced in time t is

H = VIt

(11.20)

# PAGE 19

Applying Ohm's law [Eq. (11.5)], we get

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

This is known as Joule's law of heating. The law implies that heat produced in a resistor is (i) directly proportional to the square of current for a given resistance, (ii) directly proportional to resistance for a given current, and (iii) directly proportional to the time for which the current flows through the resistor. In practical situations, when an electric appliance is connected to a known voltage  source,  Eq.  (11.21)  is  used  after calculating  the  current  through  it,  using  the relation I = V/R .

## Example 11.10

An electric iron consumes energy at a rate of 840 W when heating is at the maximum rate and 360 W when the heating is at the minimum. The voltage is 220 V. What are the current and the resistance in each case?

## Solution

From Eq. (11.19), we know that the power input is P = V I

Thus the current I = P/V

- (a) When heating is at the maximum rate, I = 840 W/220 V = 3.82 A; and the resistance of the electric iron is

R = V/I = 220 V/3.82 A = 57.60 Ω .

- (b) When heating is at the minimum rate, I = 360 W/220 V = 1.64 A; and the resistance of the electric iron is R = V/I = 220 V/1.64 A = 134.15 Ω .

## Example 11.11

100 J of heat is produced each second in a 4 Ω resistance. Find the potential difference across the resistor.

## Solution

H = 100 J, R = 4 Ω , t = 1 s, V = ?

From Eq. (11.21) we have the current through the resistor as

- I = √ ( H/Rt )
- = √ [100 J/(4 Ω × 1 s)]
- = 5 A

Thus the potential difference across the resistor, V [from Eq. (11.5)] is

V = IR

= 5 A × 4 Ω

= 20 V.

## 11.7.1 Practical Applications of Heating Effect of Electric Current

The generation of heat in a conductor is an inevitable consequence of electric current. In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful electrical energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heating can increase the temperature of the components and alter their properties. However, heating effect of electric current has many useful applications. The electric laundry iron, electric toaster, electric oven, electric kettle and electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joule's heating.

The electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric bulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is possible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such high temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as tungsten (melting point 3380°C) is used for making bulb filaments. The filament  should  be  thermally  isolated  as  much  as  possible,  using insulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually filled with chemically inactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most of the power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part of it is in the form of light radiated.

Another common application of Joule's heating is the fuse used in electric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow of any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series with the device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of appropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper, iron, lead etc. If a current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit, the temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and breaks the circuit. The fuse wire is usually encased in a cartridge of porcelain or similar material with metal ends. The fuses used for domestic purposes are rated as 1 A, 2 A, 3 A, 5 A, 10 A, etc. For an electric iron which consumes 1 kW electric power when operated at 220 V, a current of (1000/220) A, that is, 4.54 A will flow in the circuit. In this case, a 5 A fuse must be used.

## 11.8  ELECTRIC  POWER 11.8  ELECTRIC  POWER

You have studied in your earlier Class that the rate of doing work is power. This is also the rate of consumption of energy.

Equation (11.21) gives the rate at which electric energy is dissipated or consumed in an electric circuit. This is also termed as electric power. The power P is given by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The SI unit of electric power is watt (W). It is the power consumed by a device that carries 1 A of current when operated at a potential difference of 1 V. Thus,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The unit 'watt' is very small. Therefore, in actual practice we use a much larger unit called 'kilowatt'. It is equal to 1000 watts. Since electrical energy is the product of power and time, the unit of electric energy is, therefore, watt hour (W h). One watt hour is the energy consumed when 1 watt of power is used for 1 hour. The commercial unit of electric energy is kilowatt hour (kW h), commonly known as 'unit'.

1 kW h = 1000 watt × 3600 second

- = 3.6 × 10 6  watt second
- = 3.6 × 10 6 joule (J)

Many people think that electrons are consumed in an electric circuit. This is wrong! We pay the electricity board or electric company to provide energy to move electrons through the electric gadgets like electric bulb, fan and engines. We pay for the energy that we use.

## Example 11.12

An electric bulb is connected to a 220 V generator. The current is 0.50 A. What is the power of the bulb?

## Solution

- P = VI
- = 220 V × 0.50 A
- = 110 J/s
- = 110 W.

## Example 11.13

An electric refrigerator rated 400 W operates 8 hour/day. What is the cost of the energy to operate it for 30 days at Rs 3.00 per kW h?

# PAGE 22

## Solution

The total energy consumed by the refrigerator in 30 days would be 400 W × 8.0 hour/day × 30 days = 96000 W h

= 96 kW h

Thus the cost of energy to operate the refrigerator for 30 days is 96 kW h × Rs 3.00 per kW h = Rs 288.00
