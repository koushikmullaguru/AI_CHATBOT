## Let's Begin

In the 'Glimpses of India' ( First Flight , Class X textbook, NCERT) you have read about interesting people and places. India is a place of diversity in terms of culture, language, food, traditions, etc. There are many stories unknown to us about the way of life of people. Work in groups of four and find out about the following in any five Indian states.

-  Their regional cuisine
-  Dance form and music
-  Art form
-  Any other information

Mark these five places on a map and represent the information highlighting the interesting facts.

The following is an excerpt about the Parsi community in India and their food.

Read the passage and answer the questions.

' Aavoji , aavo , aavo !  Welcome  to  Delhi!  Let  me  show  you  my beautiful  city.'  The  booming  voice  of  Nowrosji  Kapadia  could be heard across the length and breadth of the platform. It was Nowrosji's  favourite  pastime:  a  walk  to  the  Old  Delhi  railway station to greet the Frontier Mail as it chugged into Delhi from Mumbai to Peshawar. With this refrain, an eager Nowrosji would cajole Parsi visitors off the train and take them home for a meal and often persuade some to stay overnight or for a few days. He

would use this opportunity to tell them about the advantages of shifting to Delhi. Though his wife Jer Bai would occasionally object to unknown visitors, she was always overruled. This was the beginning of the community of Parsis in Delhi....

...Writing about Parsis in the Delhi of old is not easy. There are memories of my grandparents and parents  -  a collective memory of generations past and people long gone, yet here in spirit....

During  festive  gatherings,  the  women  went  to  town  with  the food; outside catering was unheard of. The poorer members of the community never knew who had paid for what. This tradition continued  in  the  northern  cities  of  Lucknow,  Kanpur,  and Allahabad well into the '70s. Sadly, that kind of life has almost gone forever.

Food preparations began two days in advance. Dar ni pori (rich pastry stuffed with sweetened lentils) and malido ( halwa )  were carried in big vatus (pots) and served with puris . Anyone who has made malido can vouch for the fact that you need strong biceps; it is an exhausting exercise. The first time I made it under my grandmother's supervision was also the last. I could hardly move my arms for the next two days! Since then, I gained a healthy respect for my dainty grandmother.

The menu was extensive. Breakfast would start with either sev -brown  vermicelli  cooked  in  milk  and  served  with  fresh cream-or ravo ,  semolina  pudding, Mithu  dahi or  sweetened curd made with full cream milk was an absolute must. This was followed  by bafellaeeda ,  hard-boiled  eggs,  and kheemo  kaleji , mutton mince with liver.  For  lunch,  there  was  almost  always smori dal  chawal and macchi no patio - white boiled rice with yellow dal offset by a tart and tangy fish curry.

Teatime was special at our home. My grandmother made it a point to dress for tea; I was made to do the same. Once we were ready, out came the treats: Parsi biscuits  batasa , nankhatai and flaky khari ; patrel , rolled, steamed arbi leaves stuffed with besan masala ; kumas ,  rich Parsi cake; and my favourite, bhakra , sweet deep fried doughnuts. That tradition has stayed with me. I certainly don't dress up, but I still need a snack with at least three cups of tea!...

## text ii

You have read about Coorg, its rainforests, and coffee and tea from Assam in 'Glimpses of India' ( First Flight , Class X textbook, NCERT). The following extract is about the cultivation of coffee in  Araku valley in Andhra Pradesh. The story of Araku Valley traverses an unusual trajectory through Adivasi empowerment, hot-air balloons and some of the best coffee in the world.

Read the passage given below and answer the questions.

Located at about 1,200m above sea level, the valley, tucked away in the north-eastern corner of Andhra Pradesh, shares a border with Odisha. For guests and participants at the Araku Balloon Festival (ABF), held between 18-20 January every year, this is sightseeing like nothing else.

The drive to far-flung coffee estates takes us through the five northern  mandals  of  Anantha  giri,  Dumbriguda,  Hukumpeta, Munchingi  Puttu  and  Araku  valley.  The  name  Araku  for  the coffee was chosen simply because it sounded poetic. The view from the ground level is as impressive as the one from above the landscape changes from densely forested hills to sweeping valleys and terrace farms surrounding occasional village clusters. The journey of Araku Coffee from a livelihood initiative by the Naandi Foundation to a globally appreciated product has been in the making for over a decade. It is also intrinsically tied to the history of how coffee arrived in this valley. It was a British civil servant, N.S. Brodie, who introduced coffee to these hill tracts in 1898.

E

Today, Araku coffee is a brand that works with 517 villages and 10,986 farmers, all of whom are estate owners and entrepreneurs with a stake in the business. The reason the coffee is of such high quality is that it follows the best practices of bio-dynamic farming by creating an interconnected and symbiotic ecosystem. The soil is  enriched  through  composting  and  a  variety  of  shade  trees are planted, including cash-yielding fruit trees like mango and jackfruit. Terroirs are assessed and careful standard operating procedures are put in place from 'sapling to savouring', which ensures healthier plants and sweeter cherries and eventually a far superior coffee aroma and flavour.

## The Valley of Flowers

The journey to the Valley of Flowers begins about 16 km away from Joshimath, at Govindghat (1,770 m) on the RishikeshBadrinath heightway. The Valley of Flowers is covered with a rich varity of magnifiscent plants.

Over the past few years, thousand of visitors have 'discovered' this idyll amidst the mountain. However, they live like marks only by way of empty cans, waste-paper and cigarete butts. Trakking in the area has resulted in the trampling of these delikate  plants  by  humans  and  ponies.  As  a  result,  the government of India was compeled to ban all mountainering, trekking, expeditions and livestock grasing in the area, with effect  from  February  20,  1983.  This  is  to  privent  further damage to one of our nation's unique repositories of natural beauty.

Ask your classmate or teacher to read aloud the following passage  from  the  text  'Glimpses  of  India'  ( First  Flight, Class  X  textbook).  Listen  carefully,  and  note  down  the keywords, main ideas and interesting expressions in your notebook while listening.

During our childhood in Goa, the baker used to be our friend, companion and guide. He used to come at least twice a day. Once, when he set out in the morning on his selling round, and then again, when he returned after emptying his huge basket. The jingling thud of his bamboo woke us up from sleep and we ran to meet and greet him. Why was it so? Was it for the love of the loaf? Not at all. The loaves were bought by some Paskine or Bastine, the maid-servant of the house! What we longed for were those bread -bangles which we chose carefully. Sometimes it was sweet bread of a special kind.

The  baker  made  his  musical  entry  on  the  scene  with the  'jhang,  jhang -sound  of  his  specially  made  bamboo staff. One hand supported the basket on his head and the other banged the bamboo on the ground. He would greet the lady of the house with a 'Good morning' and then place his basket  on  the  vertical  bamboo.  We  kids  would  be  pushed aside with a mild rebuke and the loaves would be delivered to the servant. But we would not give up. We would climb a bench or the parapet and peep into the basket, somehow. I can still recall the typical fragrance of those loaves; loaves for the elders and the bangles for the children. Then we did not even care to brush our teeth or wash our mouths properly. And why should we? Who would take the trouble of plucking the mango leaf for the toothbrush? And why was it necessary at all? The tiger never brushed his teeth. Hot tea could wash and clean up everything so nicely, after all!

Now summarise the paragraph using your notes.

Traditional breads are famous in Kashmir as well. It is said that a Kashmiri's day starts with a cup of piping hot nun chai (salty pink tea) and a crisp, freshly baked bread from the Kandur (the traditional baker). In Kashmir, the Kandur shop isn't just a place where one goes to buy the morning and evening breads, it is a social hub. It is a place where you get to hear and participate in discussions that range from gossip to political discourses. The Kandur shop or Kandur waan as  it  is  called  in  Kashmiri  has  variety  of  breads  for different occasions that are baked in the Kandur's oven.

## Read about some of the Kashmiri breads:
