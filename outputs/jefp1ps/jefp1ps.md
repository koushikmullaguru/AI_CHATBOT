The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that children's life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage  rote  learning  and  the  maintenance  of  sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined  in the National Policy of Education (1986).

The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children  generate  new  knowledge  by  engaging  with  the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.

These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also  determine  how  effective  this  book  proves  for  making children's life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the  problem  of  curricular  burden  by  restructuring  and reorienting  knowledge  at  different  stages  with  greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for

teaching. The supplementary reader attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank  the  Chairperson  of  the  advisory  committee for  textbooks  in  languages  for  the  secondary  stage, Professor Namwar Singh, and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor R. Amritavalli  for guiding the work of this committee. Several  teachers  contributed  to  the  development  of  this supplementary reader; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, materials and personnel.  We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed  by  the  Department  of  Secondary  and  Higher Education,  Ministry  of  Human  Resource  Development under the  Chairpersonship  of  Professor  Mrinal  Miri  and Professor  G.P.  Deshpande  for  their  valuable  time  and contribution. As an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision and refinements.

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise  the  textbooks  across  all  classes.  Learning  Outcomes  already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.

## Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:

- Content based on genres of literature in the textbooks and supplementary readers at different stages of school education.
- Content that is meant for achieving Learning Outcomes for developing language proficiency and is accessible at different stages.
- For reducing the curriculum load and examination stress in view of the prevailing condition of the Pandemic.
- Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning.
- Content, which is irrelevant in the present context.

This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given above.

Footprints without Feet , a supplementary reader in English for Class X, is based on the new syllabus prepared as a follow-up to the National Curriculum Framework, 2005. The curriculum envisages language learning opportunities that are rich in comprehensible input, and adopts a language-across-thecurriculum, multilingual perspective on English in the school. Input-rich communicational environments are a prerequisite for language learning. Therefore, learners must be exposed to a variety of texts.

The supplementary reader is meant for students to read on their own; it aims at developing their reading skills. Learners need to  develop  the  habit  of  reading  for  information  and pleasure, drawing inferences from what they read, and relating texts  to  their  previous  knowledge.  They  need  to  learn  to read  critically  and  to  develop  the  confidence  to  ask  and answer questions.

The  selections  in  the  supplementary  reader  take  into account the interests of young learners while making them aware  of  issues  that  they  need  to  reflect  on:  personal relationships, the neighbourhood, and the community. Thematic variety has been taken care of and there is a good representation of a variety of genres as well as of writers from across the worldIndian,  British,  French,  American  and  Japanese.  This supplementary reader has ten pieces including a play and a factual prose piece, as well as science fiction.

Each piece begins with questions under the head 'Read and Find Out' to guide learners in their reading and comprehension of the text, which is divided into two to three sections, each section prefaced with relevant questions. Thus the texts do not need to be read out or explained by the teacher in class. Word glosses have similarly been kept to the minimum so as to  encourage  inferences  about  meaning  from  sentential and  discourse  contexts.  The  teacher,  after  a  quick  oral comprehension check, if necessary, can progress to the questions

under the head 'Think About It' at the end of each unit. These are meant to take the learner beyond factual comprehension to contemplate on the issues that the texts raise; the questions are open ended and thought provoking.

The questions given under 'Talk About It' are intended to encourage the learners to express their own ideas in a creative and coherent way. It is hoped that the topics suggested for discussion will encourage learners to develop a constructive analysis  of  the  relevant  issues,  involving  critical  thinking, reasoning, and previous knowledge as well as new knowledge.

The list of suggested readings given at the end of each story is meant to encourage learners to read further on their own. The idea is to promote the habit of self-learning and reduce dependence on the teacher.

Language learning is essentially a matter of acquiring in an integrated way the skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing; and of honing these skills for effective communication in the classroom, and later in real life. This book offers an opportunity for taking learners in that direction.
