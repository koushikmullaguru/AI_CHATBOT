## READ AND FIND OUT

- Why was the twentieth century called the 'Era of the Book'?
- Who tried to invade the earth in the twenty-first century?

TIME :

The twenty-fifth century

PLACE :

The Museum of Ancient History: Department of the Twentieth Century  on the Planet Earth

BEFORE RISE

- : Spotlight shines on Historian, who is sitting at a table down right, on which is a movie projector . A sign on an easel beside her reads: Museum of Ancient History: Department of the Twentieth Century . She stands and bows to audience.

HISTORIAN

- : Good afternoon. Welcome to our Museum of Ancient History,  and  to  my  department  -  curiosities  of  the good  old,  far-off  twentieth  century.  The  twentieth century was often called the Era of the Book. In those days,  there  were  books  about  everything,  from  ant eaters to Zulus. Books taught people how to, and when to,  and  where  to,  and  why  to.  They  illustrated, educated, punctuated, and even decorated. But the

strangest thing a book ever did was to save the Earth. You haven't heard about the Martian invasion of 2040? Tsk, tsk. What do they teach children nowadays? Well, you know, the invasion never really happened, because a single book stopped it. What was the book, you ask? A  noble  encyclopedia?  A  tome  about  rockets  and missiles?  A  secret  file  from  outer  space?  No,  it  was none of those. It was - but here, let me turn on the historiscope  and  show  you  what  happened  many centuries  ago,  in  2040.  ( She turns on projector, and points it left. Spotlight on Historian goes out, and comes up down left on Think-Tank, who is seated on a raised box, arms folded. He has a huge, egg-shaped head, and he wears a long robe decorated with stars and circles. Apprentice Noodle stands beside him at an elaborate switchboard. A sign on an easel reads:

## MARS SPACE CONTROL

GREAT AND MIGHTY THINK-TANK, COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF (Bow low before entering)

NOODLE :

( bowing )  O  Great  and  Mighty  Think-Tank,  most powerful  and  intelligent  creature  in  the  whole universe,  what  are  your  orders?

THINK-TANK :

( peevishly )  You  left  out  part  of  my  salutation, Apprentice Noodle. Go over the whole thing again.

NOODLE :

It shall be done, sir. ( in a singsong ) O Great and Mighty Think-Tank, Ruler of Mars and her two moons, most powerful  and  intelligent  creature  in  the  whole universe - ( out  of  breath )  what-are-your-orders?

THINK-TANK :

That's  better,  Noodle.  I  wish  to  be  placed  in communication with our manned space probe to that ridiculous little planet we are going to put under our generous rulership. What do they call it, again?

NOODLE :

Earth,  your  Intelligence.

THINK-TANK

: Earth - of course. You see how insignificant the place is? But first, something important. My mirror. I wish to consult my mirror.

NOODLE :

It shall be done, sir. ( He hands Think-Tank a mirror .)

THINK-TANK

: Mirror,  mirror,  in  my  hand.  Who  is  the  most fantastically  intellectually  gifted  being  in  the  land?

OFFSTAGE VOICE :

(after a pause ) You, sir.

THINK-TANK :

( smacking mirror )  Quicker. Answer quicker next time. I hate a slow mirror . (He admires himself in the mirror. ) Ah,  there  I  am.  Are  we  Martians  not  a  handsome race?  So  much  more  attractive  than  those  ugly Earthlings with their tiny heads. Noodle, you keep on exercising  your  mind,  and  someday  you'll  have  a balloon brain just like mine.

NOODLE

: Oh, I hope so, Mighty Think-Tank. I hope so.

THINK-TANK

: Now, contact the space probe. I want to invade that primitive  ball  of  mud  called  Earth  before  lunch.

NOODLE :

It shall be done, sir. ( He adjusts levers on switchboard. Electronic buzzes and beeps are heard as the curtains open.)

## SCENE 2

## READ AND FIND OUT

- What guesses are made by Think-Tank about the books found on earth?

TIME :

A few seconds later

PLACE :

Mars Space Control and the Centerville Public Library

AT RISE :

Captain Omega stands at centre, opening and closing card catalogue drawers in a confused fashion. Lieutenant Iota is up left, counting books in a bookcase. Sergeant Oop is at right, opening and closing a book, turning it upside down, shaking it and then riffling the pages and shaking his head.

NOODLE :

( adjusting knobs ) I  have a close sighting of the space crew,  sir.

( Think-Tank puts on a pair of enormous goggles and turns towards the stage to watch .) They seem to have entered some sort of Earth structure.

THINK-TANK :

Excellent.  Make  voice  contact.

We have taken shelter in this (indicates  room )  -  this  square  place.  Have  you  any idea  where  we  are,  Lieutenant  Iota?
- : I  can't  figure  it  out,  Captain. (holding up a book )  I've counted two thousand of these peculiar items. This place must be some sort of storage barn. What do you think,  Sergeant  Oop?
- : I  haven't  a  clue.  I've  been  to  seven  galaxies,  but  I've never  seen  anything  like  this.  Maybe  they're  hats. (He opens a book and puts it on his head .) Say, maybe this  is  a  haberdashery!
- : ( bowing low )  Perhaps  the  Great  and  Mighty  ThinkTank  will  give  us  the  benefit  of  his  thought  on the  matter.

THINK-TANK

: Elementary, my dear Omega. Hold one of the items up so that I may view it closely. ( Omega holds a book on the palm of her hand .) Yes, yes, I understand now. Since  Earth  creatures  are  always  eating,  the  place in which you find yourselves is undoubtedly a crude refreshment stand.

OMEGA :

(to Iota and Oop ) He says we're in a refreshment stand.

OOP :

Well,  the  Earthlings  certainly  have  a  strange  diet.

THINK-TANK

: That item in your hand is called a sandwich.

OMEGA :

(nodding )  A  sandwich.

IOTA :

( nodding) A  sandwich.

OOP

:

( taking book from his head ) A sandwich?

THINK-TANK

: Sandwiches are the main staple of Earth diet. Look at  it  closely.( Omega squints  at  book .)  There  are  two slices  of  what  is  called  bread,  and  between  them  is some sort of filling.

OMEGA :

That is  correct,  sir.

THINK-TANK

: To confirm my opinion, I order you to eat it.

OMEGA :

( gulping )  Eat it?

THINK-TANK

: Do you doubt the Mighty Think-Tank?

OMEGA

: Oh, no, no. But poor Lieutenant Iota has not had her breakfast.  Lieutenant Iota,  I  order  you  to  eat  this  - this  sandwich.

IOTA :

( dubiously )  Eat  it?  Oh,  Captain!  It's  a  very  great honour to be the first Martian to eat a sandwich, I'm sure,  but  -  but  how  can  I  be  so  impolite  as  to  eat before my Sergeant? (handing Oop the book and saying brightly) Sergeant Oop, I order you to eat the sandwich immediately.

OOP :

( making a face )  Who, Lieutenant? Me, Lieutenant?

IOTA and OMEGA :

( saluting ) For the glory of Mars, Oop!

OOP :

Yes, of course! ( unhappily ) Immediately. ( He opens his mouth wide. Omega and Iota watch him breathlessly. He bites down on a corner of the book, and pantomimes chewing and swallowing, while making terrible faces.)

OMEGA :

Well,  Oop?

IOTA :

Well, Oop? ( Oop coughs . Omega and Iota pound him on the back .)

THINK-TANK

: Was it not delicious, Sergeant Oop?

OOP :

( saluting )  That  is  correct,  sir.  It  was not delicious.  I don't  know  how  the  Earthlings  can  get  those sandwiches  down  without  water.  They're  dry  as Martian dust.

NOODLE :

Sir,  sir.  Great  and  Mighty  Think-Tank.  I  beg  your pardon, but an insignificant  bit  of  data  floated  into my mind about those sandwiches.

THINK-TANK :

It  can't  be  worth  much,  but  go  ahead.  Give  us  your trifling  bit  of  data.

NOODLE :

Well,  sir,  I  have  seen  surveyor  films  of  those sandwiches. I noticed that the Earthlings did not eat them. They used them as some sort of communication device.

THINK-TANK :

(haughtily) Naturally.  That  was my next point. These are actually communication sandwiches. Think-Tank is  never wrong. Who is never wrong?

ALL :

(saluting ) Great and Mighty Think-Tank is never wrong.

THINK-TANK :

Therefore, I order you to listen to them.

Listen  to  them?

IOTA AND OOP :

( to each other, puzzled )  Listen to them?

THINK-TANK

: Do you have marbles in your ears? I said, listen to them. (Martians bow very low.)

OMEGA :

It  shall  be  done,  sir.  ( They each take two books from the case, and hold them to their ears, listening intently .)

IOTA :

( whispering to Omega ) Do you hear anything?

OMEGA :

( whispering back ) Nothing. Do you hear anything, Oop?

OOP :

( loudly ) Not a thing! ( Omega and Iota jump in fright .)

OMEGA AND IOTA

: Sh-h-h! ( They listen intently again .)

THINK-TANK

: Well? Well? Report to me. What do you hear?

OMEGA :

Nothing,  sir.  Perhaps  we  are  not  on  the  correct frequency.

IOTA :

Nothing,  sir.  Perhaps  the  Earthlings  have  sharper ears than we do.

OOP :

I  don't  hear  a  thing.  Maybe  these  sandwiches  don't make sounds.

THINK-TANK

: What? Does somebody suggest the Mighty Think-Tank has made a mistake?

OMEGA :

Oh, no, sir; no, sir. We'll keep listening.

NOODLE

: Please excuse me, your Brilliance, but a cloudy piece of  information is twirling around in my head.

THINK-TANK :

Well, twirl it out, Noodle, and I will clarify it for you.

NOODLE :

I  seem  to  recall  that  the  Earthlings  did  not listen to the sandwiches; they opened them and watched them.

THINK-TANK :

Yes,  that  is  quite  correct,  I  will  clarify  that  for  you, Captain  Omega.  Those  sandwiches  are  not  for  ear communication, they are for eye communication. Now, Captain Omega, take that large, colourful sandwich over  there.  It  appears  to  be  important.  Tell  me  what you observe.

( Omega picks up a very large volume of Mother Goose , holding it  so  that  the  audience  can  see  the  title. Iota looks  over  her  left  shoulder,  and Oop peers over her right shoulder .)

OOP :

It's  little  lines  and  squiggles  and  dots  -  thousands of  them  alongside  the  pictures.

THINK-TANK :

Perhaps  the  Earthlings  are  not  as  primitive  as  we have thought. We must break the code.

NOODLE :

Forgive me, your Cleverness, but did not the chemical department give our space people vitamins to increase their  intelligence?

THINK-TANK

: Stop! A thought of magnificent brilliance has come to me. Space people, our chemical department has given you vitamins to increase your intelligence. Take them immediately  and  then  watch  the  sandwich.  The meaning of the code will slowly unfold before you.

: It  shall  be  done,  sir.  Remove  vitamins.  ( Crew takes vitamins from boxes on their belts .)  Present  vitamins. ( They hold vitamins out in front of them, stiffly .) Swallow

THINK-TANK :

( alarmed )  Stop!  This  is  no  time  for  levity.  Don't  you realise  the  seriousness  of  this  discovery?  The Earthlings  have  discovered  how  to  combine agriculture and mining. They can actually grow crops of rare metals such as silver. And cockle shells. They can  grow  high  explosives,  too.  Noodle,  contact  our invasion  fleet.

HISTORIAN :

( chuckling )  And  that's  how  one  dusty  old  book  of nursery  rhymes  saved  the  world  from  a  Martian invasion. As you all know, in the twenty-fifth century, five  hundred  years  after  all  this  happened,  we Earthlings resumed contact with Mars, and we even became very friendly with the Martians. By that time, Great and Mighty Think-Tank had been replaced by a  very  clever  Martian  -  the  wise  and  wonderful Noodle! Oh, yes, we taught the Martians the difference between sandwiches and books. We taught them how to  read,  too,  and  we  established  a  model  library  in their  capital  city  of  Marsopolis.  But  as  you  might expect, there is still  one  book  that  the  Martians  can never bring themselves to read. You've guessed it - Mother Goose ! (She bows and exits right. )

1. Noodle avoids offending Think-Tank but at the same time he corrects his mistakes. How does he manage to do that?
2. If  you were in Noodle's place, how would you handle Think-Tank's mistakes?
3. Do you think books are being replaced by the electronic media? Can we do away with books altogether?
4. Why are books referred to as a man's best companion? Which is your favourite book and why? Write a paragraph about that book.

## Talk/.notdefabout/.notdefit

1. In  what  ways  does  Think-Tank  misinterpret  innocent  nursery rhymes as threats to the Martians? Can you think of any incidents where you misinterpreted a word or an action? How did you resolve the  misunderstanding?
2. The aliens  in  this  play  speak  English.  Do  you  think  this  is  their language? What could be the language of the aliens?

## Answers given by Professor Yash Pal and Dr Rahul Pal

(see questions on page 38 )

- (i) DNA exists  as  strands  of  bases  that  carry  genetic  information specific  to  each  living  thing.  The  sequence  of  bases  of  DNA  in each of our cells  is  the  same,  but  differs  from  that  of  any  other living thing except possibly an identical twin. This difference makes the  DNA  break  at  different  places  when  certain  proteins  called enzymes are added to it, resulting in  smaller  DNA  fragments  of different  sizes.  These  fragments  migrate  at  different  rates  in  an electric field, resulting in a unique pattern; this pattern is referred to as a DNA fingerprint.

Our DNA is inherited from our parents. Some parts come from the father and some from the mother. DNA fingerprinting can help identify parentage, since a son or a daughter would always exhibit a  pattern  identifiable  as  coming  from  both  parents.  DNA fingerprinting  analysis  is  very  useful  in  forensic  science;  from  a single hair or a tiny spot of blood, it is possible to prove the innocence or guilt of a murder suspect. Similarly, it is also possible to identify human remains after violent accidents have caused disfigurement.

It has been suggested that in the not so distant future, a DNA fingerprinting  profile  of  the  individual  will  have  to  accompany applications for an ID card, a bank account and a driving license. Human right groups say this type of 'genetic profiling' constitutes an  invasion  of  privacy.  As  with  a  lot  of  new  technology,  DNA fingerprinting  also  has  a  potential  for  abuse.

- (ii) Honeybees  are  very  sophisticated  at  position,  location  and navigation.  It  is  known  that  they  use  the  sun  as  a  guide.  They also appear to have a good memory. They convey the information of a new find of food to the hive through an amazingly clever dance language. The dance indicates the direction and distance of the food source with respect to the direction of the sun in the sky! If it is dark inside the hive and a light bulb is switched on, the dance is modified to include the light bulb as a new reference direction! Since bees have pictorial memory of some sort, a direction-finding mechanism and a way of reckoning distance, they are probably better equipped for getting back home than any of us!
- (iii) Rain is the result of condensation of vapour when the air is cooled below the dew point. All the vapour in a cloud cannot condense at the same time and turn into a large pool of water. Pockets of air move up independently and slowly cool till condensation begins and water droplets form. It is believed that most raindrops start out  as  tiny  ice  crystals  -  so  tiny  that  they  float  down,  slowly accreting more moisture on the way; at lower altitudes, the crystals melt into water droplets. In colder climates, the crystals reach the ground as snowflakes.
