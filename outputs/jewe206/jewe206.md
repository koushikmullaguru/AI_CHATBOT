Look Up and Understand arboreal inculcate nocturnal omnivorous rehabilitates

## Reading CompRehension

The following is a story of a baby Civet cat that fell from a tree and was raised by humans. It is a true story from Assam written by Rommel Shunmugam who is a conservation photographer. Through his photo stories, he seeks to inculcate in children a love for nature and wildlife.

Civet cats are found in most parts of India. They are also called toddy cats. They live on palm trees and love to drink the sweet sap, which is collected by toddy tappers to make wine! Dharini and his family rescues and rehabilitates wild animals. These are mostly babies or animals that cannot look after themselves.

## Baby Bhakat

Hi! My name is Bhakat. I am a baby Civet cat. I am three month old. Shhh! I am taking a nap with my brothers. Yes, I live in a family of humans. They treat me like their own Baby!

My home is a little thatched hut by a river in a small village in Assam. The hut has an earthen floor  and  mud-splattered  walls.  Its  doors  are always open. I come and go as I please! Mama takes care of all three of us! Her name is Anjali. She cooks, cleans and plays with me. I secretly think she loves me the most. She lets me be real naughty!

Mama is about to make brunch! She is making roti and vegetables. I don't like vegetables, but I like fruits. I love meat. I am omnivorous. Mama always feeds me before anyone else! I love things dipped in milk. They are yummy!

The man of the house is Dharini. If not for him, I would not be alive today! My civet mother built a nest for me in a very tall coconut tree. One night I  slipped and fell to the ground! When villagers

found me they took me to Dharini. Dharini loves animals. I began to live in his home. I was very small. I could not walk. I ate and slept a lot!

Do you know why my eyes are so large? That's because I am a nocturnal animal. I sleep in the day and am active in the night. My large eyes help me see better in the dark! I also have a very long tail! It helps me balance on tree-tops and branches. I mostly live on trees, though I do come down to the ground. Animals like me are called arboreal!

Inside Dharini's house, I always snooze in the rafters. I like being high up; it reminds me of trees! One day I woke up to find a strange sight, Dharini's house was filling with water! In the night, the river behind the house started overflowing its banks! Inside everything was helter-skelter. Things were piled on top of one another! The monsoon had arrived!

Dharini and Anjali carried us babies outside the house! There was water everywhere and it was very muddy! But the sun was out and it was not raining! I stayed high on the fence and made sure even my long tail did not get wet! Dharini went to pick snails.

Snails had climbed branches and walls to escape drowning in the flood! Every gardener knows that snails eat plants. By eating snails, I ensure that they do not overrun your garden. I maintain the balance of life in nature!

When it floods, you find fish everywhere! Dharini cast his net in the garden and began catching fishes. They are kept in a pan of water to keep them alive and fresh to eat!

Montu, my brother, tried to be naughty! He caught me and threatened to dip me in water! He got a scolding from Dharini. I hate to be in water!  Back inside the house, it is time for me to play with Mama! I shall rest awhile and then be up again at night. Mama always leaves a midnight snack by the lantern!

## Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow.

It's not easy having Elephants in your backyard.

![Image](outputs/jewe206/jewe206_artifacts/image_000009_ecee07b1b37ec3cfe6bc19514482620ab6110a054c66a2c4847f7cf6a7077eaf.png)

Around  the  world,  as  communities  expand,  and  natural  wild places are reduced, people and wildlife are increasingly coming into conflict over living space and food.

It  might  be  baboons  in  Namibia  attacking  young  goats  or elephants in Nepal eating crops or European bears and wolves killing livestock. The problem is universal, affects rich and poor, and is bad news for all concerned.

The  impacts  are  often  huge.  People  lose  their  crops  and livestock (and therefore a source of income and food security), property, and sometimes their lives  -  even a severe injury caused by wildlife can result in a loss of livelihood. The animals, some of which are already threatened or even endangered, are sometimes killed in retaliation or to prevent future conflicts.

Human-wildlife conflict is happening more and more, affecting a lot of different species. The effects of climate change will probably make the problem worse.

## How we are tackling human-wildlife conflict

The solutions are often specific to the wildlife or area concerned, and are often creative and simple  -  for instance planting a barrier of crops that repel the animals (elephants and some other wildlife don't like chilli, for example).

An important aspect of the work is that it benefits both the animals and local people and actively involves the communities concerned (in the case of chilli, it can be sold to increase income). It's  about  finding  solutions  that  lead  to  mutually  beneficial coexistence.

The work has also often led to people being more enthusiastic and  supportive  of  conservation,  and  has  demonstrated  that people can live alongside wildlife while developing sustainable livelihoods.

Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow.

## Animal rights

People  who  support  animal  rights  recognise  that  all  animals have an inherent worth, a value completely separate from their usefulness to humans. Every being with a will to live has the right to live free from exploitation and suffering.

All animals have the ability to suffer in the same way and to the same degree that humans do. They feel pain, pleasure, fear, frustration, loneliness, and familial love. Whenever we consider doing something that would interfere with their needs, we are morally obligated to take them into account.

People often ask if animal rights mean that animals should have the right to vote or drive a car. Of course, that would be silly because those aren't rights that would benefit animals. But animals have the right not to suffer at the hands of humans and to  live  their  lives  free  from  suffering  and  exploitation  because they have an interest in doing so. That is the difference between equal consideration and equal treatment.

Almost everyone cares about animals in some context, whether it's a beloved family companion, an irresistibly cute kitten or a majestic wild animal seen in a documentary. After all, we each have some built-in capacity for empathy and compassion, as can

be seen from the lengths that children often go to in order to help animals.

Logically and morally, there is no reason to differentiate in the way we treat the animals we share our homes with and those who are farmed for food. They are all individuals, with the same capacity to feel pain and fear. Animal rights help us to look past the arbitrary distinctions between different species, to rediscover our innate compassion, and to respect all animals equally.

Anyone  who  cares  about  animals  can  start  putting  these principles into practice every single day with the food they eat, the clothes they wear, and the products they buy. These choices are  a  form  of  non-violent  protest  that  makes  a  real  difference both by reducing the profits of corporations that harm or kill animals and by creating a growing market for cruelty-free food, fashion, services, and entertainment.

## Grammar

1.  You have read about 'noun modifiers' in the chapter 'Mijbil the Otter', page 112. These give more information about a noun, hence are called noun modifiers. These are adjectives or  adjective  phrases.  Let  us  look  at  more  of  the  adjective phrases and their usage.

Example: I went to a party. It was a Christmas party. The party was lovely.

I went to a lovely Christmas party.

Now, join the sentences given below and make a simple sentence with an adjective phrase.

- (a)  I bought a Maruti car. The colour is blue. It is sporty. I bought  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  car.
- (b)  He made a speech. The speech was short. The speech was interesting.

He made  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  speech.

- (c)  Suresh went to a house. It was decorated beautifully. Suresh went  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  house.
- (d)  She bought a dress. It is a designer one but frightfully expensive. She bought  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  dress.
- (e)  The food was tasty. It was prepared quickly.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  food was tasty.

## ListeninG

- 1 .  Following is a story of Gangaram, a 130 years old crocodile, who died in a Chhattisgarh village. Listen to the story carefully and answer the questions that follow. You can listen to the recorded story or ask your teacher, sibling or friend to read the story aloud.

The incident took place in Bawamohatra, a village in Bemetra district  of  Chhattisgarh.  The  residents  of  Bawamohatra gathered  near  the  community  pond  and  started  weeping after they saw that the crocodile had died. The villagers were emotionally  attached  to  the  reptile  and  were  heartbroken after his death. About 500 people of the small village attended the last rites of their beloved crocodile, Gangaram. The over three-metre  long  crocodile  was  buried  in  Chhattisgarh's Bawamohatra village after his last rites were performed by the villagers. A forest department official estimated that the crocodile was 130 years old. The crocodile was carried to its funeral  on  a  tractor  decorated  with  flowers  and  garlands. The villagers say Gangaram was friendly. Even the kids of

the village could swim around him. He had never harmed or attacked anyone. He was not a crocodile but a friend and a divine creature for them, who was worshipped in this village. Some say that he would even eat rice and dal which was served by the villagers and kids. He was very understanding and if he saw anyone swimming near him, he used to go to the other side of the pond. Villagers used to identify themselves with the crocodile as people used to call this village  Magarmachha vala gaaon , the Crocodile's village. In fact, the villagers now wish to build a statue of Gangaram near the pond to remember their friend, who got the village a new name. It may be weird, but it could be an example of how humans and animals can coexist without harming each other.
