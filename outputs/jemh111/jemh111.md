## AREAS RELATED TO CIRCLES

## 11.1 Areas of Sector and Segment of a Circle

You have already come across the terms sector and segment of  a  circle  in  your  earlier  classes.  Recall that the portion (or part) of the circular region enclosed by two radii and the corresponding arc is called a sector of the circle and the portion (or part) of the circular  region  enclosed  between  a  chord  and  the corresponding arc is called a segment of the circle. Thus, in Fig. 11.1, shaded region OAPB is a sector of  the  circle  with  centre  O. ∠ AOB is called the

angle of the sector. Note that in this figure, unshaded region OAQB is also a sector of the  circle.  For  obvious  reasons,  OAPB  is  called  the minor  sector and OAQB is called the major sector . You can also see that angle of the major sector is 360° -∠ AOB.

Now, look at Fig. 11.2 in which AB is a chord of the circle with centre O. So, shaded region APB is a  segment  of  the  circle.  You  can  also  note  that unshaded region AQB is another segment of the circle formed by the chord AB. For obvious reasons, APB is called the minor segment and AQB is called the major segment .

Remark : When we write 'segment' and 'sector' we will mean the 'minor segment' and the 'minor sector' respectively, unless stated otherwise.

Now with this knowledge, let us try to find some relations (or formulae) to calculate their areas.

Let OAPB be a sector of a circle with centre O and radius r (see  Fig.  11.3).  Let  the  degree measure of ∠ AOB be θ .

You know that area of a circle (in fact of a circular region or disc) is π r 2 .

In a way, we can consider this circular region to be a sector forming an angle of 360° (i.e., of degree measure 360) at the centre O. Now by applying the Unitary Method, we can arrive at the area of the sector OAPB as follows:

Fig.  11.3

When degree  measure  of  the  angle  at  the  centre  is  360,  area  of  the sector  = π r 2

So, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is 1, area of the

Therefore, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is θ , area of the

.

Thus, we obtain the following relation (or formula) for area of a sector of a circle:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where r is the radius of the circle and θ the angle of the sector in degrees.

Now, a natural question arises : Can we find the  length  of  the  arc APB  corresponding  to  this sector?  Yes. Again,  by  applying  the  Unitary Method and taking the whole length of the circle (of angle 360°) as 2 π r , we can obtain the required

Now let us take the case of the area of the segment APB of a circle with centre O and radius r (see Fig. 11.4). You can see that :

Area of the segment APB = Area of the sector OAPB - Area of  OAB

=

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Note : From Fig. 11.3 and Fig. 11.4 respectively, you can observe that:

Area of the major sector OAQB =  r 2  - Area of the minor sector OAPB and             Area of major segment AQB =  r 2  - Area of the minor segment APB Let us now take some examples to understand these concepts (or results).

Example 1 : Find the area of the sector of a circle with radius 4 cm and of angle 30°. Also, find the area of the corresponding major sector (Use  = 3.14).

Solution : Given sector is OAPB (see Fig. 11.5).

For finding the area of  OAB, draw OM  AB as shown in Fig. 11.7.

Note that OA = OB. Therefore, by RHS congruence,  AMO  BMO.

So, M is the mid-point of AB and  AOM =  BOM = 1 120 60 2     .
