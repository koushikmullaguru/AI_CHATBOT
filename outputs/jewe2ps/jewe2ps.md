## Foreword

Teaching and learning of language in school education should be based on the insight that language learning is a natural process which should be  enhanced  in  school  for  academic  and  overall  achievement  of  the learners. It is extremely important that learner-centric methodologies of language learning should be promoted for eliciting critical responses, and developing sensitivity to social issues.

The focus of language learning is on developing skills of language and communicative  competence.  Language  learning  progresses  naturally with exposure to and use of language in meaningful situations. In this context,  importance  has  been  attributed  in  the National  Curriculum Framework-2005 ,  to  methods  of  teaching  which  are  process  based. These give opportunities to learners for engaging with texts through various activities and exercises and equip them for self-assessment.

In multilingual India, English has been one of the languages which is  being  learnt  in  schools.  It  is  therefore  recommended  that  English be  learnt  along  with  the  language  of  the  learners  since  it  leads  to transference  of  skills  from  the  child's  own  language  to  the  second language (English).

We, at the NCERT, make an endeavour to provide engaging, relevant, and authentic resources. This supplements and complements language acquisition and  provides opportunities for learners to associate experiences with everyday life.

The  Council  had  developed  two  books, First  Flight (textbook) and Footprint without Feet (Supplementary Reader) for Class X based  on  the National  Curriculum  Framework-2005 . The  workbook, Words and Expressions 2 is a sequential continuation of these. It has been developed taking into account the feedback on these books and needs of learners and teachers.

The  workbook  has  also  taken  into  account  the  skills  that  are critical  for  overall  development  of  the  learners,  such  as  the  skills  of collaboration, creativity and imagination, critical thinking and problem solving, communication and compassion.

We hope  this  workbook  will  serve  as  an  effective  instrument  for learners and teachers for adding quality to the teaching and learning processes.  We  are  indebted  to  the  institutions  and  organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources and materials. All the publications of the Council are regularly revised on the basis of the feedback from students, parents, teachers, and teacher educators.

## rationalisation oF Content in the textbooks

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning  with  creative  mindset.  In  this  background,  the  NCERT  has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning  Outcomes already  developed  by  the  NCERT  across  classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.

## Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:

-  Content based  on genres of literature in the textbooks  and supplementary readers at different stages of school education
-  Content that is meant for achieving Learning Outcomes for developing language proficiency and is accessible at different stages
-  For reducing the curriculum load and examination stress in view of the prevailing condition of the Pandemic
-  Content,  which  is  easily  accessible  to  students  without  much interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning
-  Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This  present  edition,  is  a  reformatted  version  after  carrying  out  the changes given above.

## About the Workbook

Words and Expressions 2 is  a  sequence  to  the  textbook  in  English  for  Class X, First Flight . Like Words and Expressions 1 , it is a self-study material. It  lays  emphasis  on  providing  a  variety  of  rich  and  comprehensible inputs. This gives learners exposure to the target language and enables them to further their skills in the English language. The passages and activities given here create opportunities for them to handle the English language for performing important language functions and help them develop  critical  thinking  on  contemporary  concerns.  The  book  is expected to help learners to read for meaning in context and also serve as a base for communication in the English language.

There are 9 units in this workbook. The chapters of the textbook and the units are to be taught in a coordinated manner. The units correspond to  each lesson in the textbook. There are various tasks in each unit. 'Let's begin' is followed by Comprehension passages, Vocabulary tasks, Grammar exercises, Editing, Listening, Speaking, and Writing activities. All units end with Project work reiterating the learning through elaborate activities. The sections have followed an integrated approach and focus on a particular skill of the English language.

The introductory section, 'Let's begin' asks questions making the students think and discuss on the chapter they have read. They are asked  to  collect  information,  read  various  written  texts  and  e-texts, watch,  and  listen  to  online  resources  from  Internet  services  like YouTube. They can also refer to the materials given in the QR code of the textbook along with the reading aloud of the texts and recitation of the poems. They are required to work in groups of two or four, note down points, develop speech, debate, etc., and then to speak before the  whole  class.  This  follows  an  integrated  process  of  reading  with comprehension, reflection, writing, and expressing thoughts.

The themes of the unseen comprehension passages, span across the  literary,  cultural,  and  sociological  realms  -  which  appeal  to  and inspire  the  adolescents  -  are  chosen  based  on  the  corresponding chapters in the textbook. Reading Comprehension has prose passages as well as poems. The familiarity of the context has been taken care of while selecting the passages. An attempt has been made to expose the learners to a variety of texts, comprehend the meaning of words in  context, understand the theme, and answer factual and thoughtprovoking questions. Learners are also given opportunities to interpret poems,  be  acquainted  with  beautiful expressions,  phrases,  and understand the expressions of the images. Some questions have been given to infer meaning and other to inspire learners to think critically and bring out their deeper understanding of the text. Multiple choice questions are also given in the book for students to assess themselves.

The workbook is a self-study material for the students. They are encouraged to work in pairs or groups so that they support each other and learn from each other. However, if required, teachers may guide. A variety of tasks, exercises, and 'Look up and understand' are placed strategically to build vocabulary in the given context. The learners are encouraged to use the dictionary as often as required. The intention is to help them learn new words and their usages in different contexts. Further, 'Proofreading marks' have been given for students to learn the basics of proofreading and editing.

The written and spoken compositions are preceded by discussions in peer groups. The themes of the composition include contemporary issues like gender, environment, diversity, human values, animal rights, adolescent issues which are relevant to the age group, and appropriate in  the  contemporary  time.  This  is  to  enable  the  learners  to  see  the world, develop necessary skills, and face the challenges of the present as well as future.

Enough opportunities are given to the students to develop listening comprehension and to use the English language in real-life situations. It is reiterated that basic language skills are developed simultaneously, not in isolation, but in an integrated manner. So integrated listening and speaking activities are given in the book. Grammar activities are presented in everyday contexts and are given with keeping usage in mind, not the formal explication of grammatical concepts.

The fine distinction of the workbook is that it is directly addressed to  the  students.  The  language  used  is  simple,  so  that  there  is  less dependence on the teachers. The activities are simple and stress free, enabling  the  learners  to  complete  these  confidently.  Self-learning  is encouraged. The pair or group work will give students an opportunity to  look  at  the  work  of  their  peers  and  make  each  of  them  feel  both responsible as well as independent. Every learner has a unique learning style.  The  group  work  may  help  them  understand  their  challenges, evaluate  themselves  vis-a-vis  their  peers,  and  find  the  best  way  to overcome them.

The project activities given at the end of each unit are expected to be engaging, across the entire curriculum and interdisciplinary. These help generate interest to explore, analyse, think critically, reflect, and then present thoughts orally or in writing.

'Fun facts' are given in the margins throughout the workbook, with the hope that the learner would have a lasting impression of the correct usage  of  the  English  language.  Teachers  must  remember  that  'Fun facts' are for joyful learning and non-evaluative.

It  is  hoped  that  this  book  will  help  students  use  the  English  language effectively  and  meaningfully  for  the  purpose  of  communication which will make them proficient and perceptive users of the English language. They will find this workbook enjoyable and rewarding as it is  learner-centered  and  activity  based.  Comments  and  suggestions on any aspect of the workbook are welcome. This would enable us to improve the next edition.
