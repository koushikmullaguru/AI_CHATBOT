TRIANGLES

## 6.1 Introduction

You are familiar with triangles and many of their properties from your earlier classes. In Class IX, you have studied congruence of triangles in detail. Recall that two figures are  said  to  be congruent ,  if  they  have  the  same  shape  and  the  same  size.  In  this chapter, we shall study about those figures which have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. Two figures having the same shape (and not necessarily the same size) are called similar figures. In particular, we shall discuss the similarity of triangles and apply this knowledge in giving a simple proof of Pythagoras Theorem learnt earlier.

Can you guess how heights of mountains (say Mount Everest) or distances of some long distant objects (say moon) have been found out? Do you think these have

been measured directly with the help of a measuring tape? In fact, all these heights and distances have been found out using the idea of indirect measurements, which is based on the principle of similarity of figures (see Example 7, Q.15 of Exercise 6.3 and also Chapters 8 and 9 of this book).

## 6.2 Similar Figures

In  Class  IX,  you  have  seen  that  all  circles  with  the  same  radii  are  congruent,  all squares with the same side lengths are congruent and all equilateral triangles with the same side lengths are congruent.

Now consider any two (or more) circles  [see  Fig.  6.1  (i)]. Are  they congruent? Since all of them do not have the same radius, they are not congruent to  each  other.  Note  that some are congruent and some are not, but all of them have the same shape. So they all are, what we call, similar . Two similar figures have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. Therefore, all circles are similar. What about two (or more) squares or two (or  more)  equilateral  triangles [see Fig. 6.1 (ii) and (iii)]?  As observed in  the  case  of  circles,  here  also  all squares are similar and all equilateral triangles are similar.

From the above, we can say that  all  congruent  figures  are similar but the similar figures need not  be  congruent.

Can a circle and a square be similar? Can a triangle and a square be similar? These questions can be answered  by  just  looking  at  the figures  (see  Fig.  6.1).  Evidently these figures are not similar. (Why?)

![Image](outputs/jemh106/jemh106_artifacts/image_000004_c15b686da73ba433f921b2a9d35f838bda2aa81ad5befe75c689be3e6e9061fb.png)

# PAGE 3

What  can  you  say  about  the  two  quadrilaterals  ABCD  and  PQRS (see Fig 6.2)?Are they similar? These  figures appear to be similar but we cannot be certain about it.Therefore, we must have some definition of similarity of figures and based on this definition some rules to decide whether the two given figures are similar or not. For this, let us look at the photographs given in Fig. 6.3:

Fig.  6.3

![Image](outputs/jemh106/jemh106_artifacts/image_000005_43eeffbcd5af7512e3e1f26e18310736bd6f4aba09f7cc536991da2c7ecd798d.png)

![Image](outputs/jemh106/jemh106_artifacts/image_000006_5b47b7fcb372d5de87e38e17442a6e0421af5c51718b94942fd2fa2b29ec2624.png)

You will at once say that they are the photographs of the same monument (Taj Mahal) but are in different sizes. Would you say that the three photographs  are similar? Yes,they are.

What can you say about the two photographs of the same size of the same person one at the age of 10 years and the other at the age of 40 years? Are these photographs similar? These photographs are of the same size but certainly they are not of the same shape. So, they are not similar.

What does the photographer do when she prints photographs of different sizes from the same negative? You must  have heard about the stamp size, passport size and postcard size photographs. She generally takes a photograph on a small size film, say of 35mm size and then enlarges it into a bigger size, say 45mm (or 55mm). Thus, if we consider any line segment in the smaller photograph (figure), its corresponding line segment in the bigger photograph (figure) will be 45 35 55 or 35       of that of the line segment.

This really  means that every line segment of the smaller photograph is enlarged (increased) in the ratio 35:45 (or 35:55).  It can also be said that every line segment of the bigger photograph is reduced (decreased) in the ratio 45:35 (or 55:35). Further, if you consider inclinations (or angles) between any pair of corresponding line segments in the two photographs of different sizes, you shall see that these inclinations(or angles) are always equal. This is the essence of the similarity of two figures and in particular of two polygons. We say that:

Two  polygons  of  the  same  number  of  sides  are  similar,  if ( i ) their corresponding  angles  are  equal  and ( ii ) their  corresponding  sides  are  in  the same ratio ( or  proportion ).

![Image](outputs/jemh106/jemh106_artifacts/image_000007_dfaea77fd84d2e67a78d2cf61367f2ee6eae145697c240d616530817b484af28.png)

Note that the same ratio of the corresponding sides is referred to as the scale factor (or the Representative Fraction ) for the polygons. You must have heard that world maps (i.e., global maps) and blue prints for the construction of a building are prepared using a suitable scale factor and observing certain conventions.

In order to understand similarity of figures more clearly, let us perform the following activity:

Activity 1 : Place  a  lighted  bulb  at  a point O on the ceiling  and directly below it a table in your classroom. Let us cut a polygon, say a quadrilateral  ABCD, from a  plane  cardboard  and  place  this cardboard parallel to the ground between the lighted bulb  and the table. Then a shadow of ABCD is cast on the table. Mark  the  outline  of  this  shadow  as A  B  C  D  (see  Fig.6.4).

Note that the quadrilateral A  B  C  D  is an enlargement (or magnification) of  the quadrilateral ABCD. This is because of the property of light that light propogates in a straight line. You may also note that A  lies on ray OA, B  lies on ray OB, C 

![Image](outputs/jemh106/jemh106_artifacts/image_000008_523a147bb5d172f96d8b9e53c49cfff4af02b5a2ee150606aa83b4be7740d4f1.png)

lies on  OC and D  lies on OD.  Thus, quadrilaterals A  B  C  D  and ABCD are of the same shape but of different sizes.

So, quadrilateral  A  B  C  D  is similiar to quadrilateral ABCD. We can also say that quadrilateral ABCD is similar to the quadrilateral A  B  C  D  .

Here,  you  can  also  note  that  vertex A  corresponds  to  vertex A,  vertex  B  corresponds to vertex B, vertex C  corresponds to vertex C and vertex  D  corresponds to vertex D. Symbolically, these correspondences are represented as A  A, B  B, C   C  and D   D.  By actually measuring the angles and the sides of the two quadrilaterals, you may verify that

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

This  again  emphasises  that two polygons of the same number of sides are similar, if ( i ) all the corresponding angles are equal and ( ii ) all the corresponding sides  are  in  the  same  ratio ( or  proportion ).

# PAGE 5

From the above, you can easily say that quadrilaterals ABCD and PQRS of Fig. 6.5 are similar.

![Image](outputs/jemh106/jemh106_artifacts/image_000009_bc29285925a333b44762202c7584e8198b13e2456eacfbed310bf40ce40e1e57.png)

Remark : You can verify that if one polygon is similar to another polygon and this second polygon is similar to a third polygon, then the first polygon is similar to the third polygon.

You may note that in the two quadrilaterals (a square and a rectangle) of Fig. 6.6, corresponding angles are equal, but their corresponding sides are not in the same ratio.

Fig.  6.6

![Image](outputs/jemh106/jemh106_artifacts/image_000010_71b6d598971c21957b6e789e1b480bfa1e6cce3421308eb06427cdef75e3a7da.png)

So, the two quadrilaterals are not similar. Similarly, you may note that in the two quadrilaterals (a square and a rhombus) of Fig. 6.7, corresponding sides are in the same ratio, but their corresponding angles are not equal. Again, the two polygons (quadrilaterals) are not similar.

Thus, either  of  the  above  two  conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) of  similarity  of  two polygons is not sufficient for them to be similar .

## 6.3 Similarity of Triangles

What can you say about the similarity of two triangles?

You may recall that triangle is also a polygon. So, we can state the same conditions for the similarity of two triangles. That is:

Two triangles are similiar, if

- ( i ) their  corresponding  angles  are  equal  and
- ( ii ) their  corresponding  sides  are  in  the  same  ratio ( or  proportion ) .

Note  that  if  corresponding  angles  of  two triangles  are  equal,  then  they  are  known  as equiangular triangles. A famous Greek mathematician Thales gave an important truth relating to two equiangular triangles which is as follows:

The ratio of any two corresponding sides in two equiangular triangles is always the same.

It is believed that he had used a result called the Basic Proportionality Theorem (now known as the Thales Theorem )  for the same.

To  understand  the  Basic  Proportionality Theorem, let us perform the following activity:

Activity 2 : Draw any angle XAY and on its one arm AX, mark points (say five points) P, Q, D, R and B such that AP = PQ = QD = DR = RB.

Now, through B, draw any line intersecting arm AY at C (see Fig. 6.9).

Also, through the point D, draw a line parallel to  BC to intersect AC at E. Do you observe from your constructions that AD 3 DB 2  ? Measure AE and

![Image](outputs/jemh106/jemh106_artifacts/image_000013_0a4e2ad65377a80f90b8955ebcd8ee7f5c51ca15008d1e130ede3d6b80553821.png)

EC. What about AE EC ? Observe that AE EC is also equal to 3 2 . Thus, you can see that in  ABC, DE || BC and AD AE DB EC  . Is it a coincidence? No, it is due to the following theorem (known as the Basic Proportionality Theorem):

# PAGE 8

Theorem 6.1 : If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle to intersect the other  two  sides  in  distinct  points,  the  other  two  sides  are  divided  in  the  same ratio.

Proof : We are given a triangle ABC in which a line parallel to side BC intersects other two sides AB and AC at D and E respectively (see Fig. 6.10).

Let us join BE and CD and then draw DM  AC and EN  AB.

Therefore, from (1), (2) and (3), we have :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Is  the  converse  of  this  theorem  also  true  (For  the  meaning  of  converse,  see Appendix 1)? To examine this, let us perform the following activity:

Activity  3  : Draw  an  angle  XAY  on  your notebook and on ray AX, mark points B 1 , B 2 , B 3 ,  B 4 and B such that AB 1 =  B 1 B 2 =  B 2 B 3 = B 3 B 4 =  B 4 B.

Similarly,  on  ray  AY,  mark  points C 1 ,  C 2 ,  C 3 ,  C 4 and C such that AC 1 =  C 1 C 2 = C 2 C 3 =  C 3 C 4 =  C 4 C.  Then join B 1 C 1 and  BC (see Fig. 6.11).

Note that

![Image](outputs/jemh106/jemh106_artifacts/image_000016_6fb182dda665ea1e82829417e5f9941e0a41e29cbe4b7a2fc31b191cab385603.png)

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

You can also see that lines B 1 C 1 and BC are parallel to each other, i.e.,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Similarly, by joining B 2 C 2 , B 3 C 3 and B 4 C 4 , you can see that:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

From (1), (2), (3) and (4), it can be observed that if a line divides two sides of a triangle in the same ratio, then the line is parallel to the third side.

You can repeat this activity by drawing any angle XAY of different measure and taking any  number of equal parts on arms AX and AY . Each time, you will arrive at the same result. Thus, we obtain the following theorem, which is the converse of Theorem 6.1:

# PAGE 10

Theorem 6.2 : If a line divides any two sides of a triangle in the same ratio, then the line is parallel to  the  third  side.

This theorem can be proved by taking a line DE such that AD AE DB EC  and assuming that DE is not parallel to BC (see Fig. 6.12).

If  DE is not parallel to BC, draw a line DE  parallel to BC.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Adding 1 to both sides of above, you can see that E and E  must coincide. (Why ?)

Let us take some examples to illustrate the use of the above theorems.

Example 1 : If a line intersects sides AB and AC of a  ABC at D and E respectively and is parallel to BC, prove that AD AB = AE AC (see Fig. 6.13).

## 6.4 Criteria for Similarity of Triangles

In the previous section, we stated that two triangles are similar, if (i) their corresponding angles are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion).

That is, in  ABC and  DEF, if

![Image](outputs/jemh106/jemh106_artifacts/image_000027_2d38569481719beae4d918df42b93a79789f184e15b6647fa81de6112bc7e1ef.png)

# PAGE 14

Here,  you  can  see  that A  corresponds  to  D,  B  corresponds  to  E  and  C corresponds to F. Symbolically, we write the similarity of these two triangles as '  ABC ~  DEF' and read it as 'triangle ABC is similar to triangle DEF'. The symbol '~' stands for 'is similar to'. Recall that you have used the symbol '  ' for 'is congruent to' in Class IX.

It  must  be  noted  that  as  done  in  the  case  of  congruency  of  two  triangles,  the similarity of two triangles should also be expressed symbolically, using correct correspondence of their vertices. For example, for the triangles ABC and DEF of Fig. 6.22, we cannot write  ABC ~  EDF or  ABC ~  FED. However, we can write  BAC ~  EDF.

Now a natural question arises : For checking the similarity of two triangles, say ABC and DEF, should we always look for all the equality relations of their corresponding angles (  A =  D,  B =  E,  C =  F) and all the equality relations of the ratios of their corresponding sides AB BC CA DE EF FD         ? Let us examine. You may recall that

in Class IX, you have obtained some criteria for congruency of two triangles involving only three pairs of corresponding parts (or elements) of the two triangles. Here also, let us make an attempt to arrive at certain criteria for similarity of two triangles involving relationship between less number of pairs of corresponding parts of the two triangles, instead of all the six pairs of corresponding parts. For this, let us perform the following activity:

Activity 4 : Draw two line segments BC and EF of two different lengths, say 3 cm and 5 cm respectively. Then, at the points B and C respectively, construct angles PBC and QCB of some measures, say, 60° and 40°. Also, at the points E and F, construct angles REF and SFE of 60° and 40° respectively (see Fig. 6.23).

# PAGE 15

Let rays BP and CQ intersect each other at A and rays ER and FS intersect each other  at  D.  In  the  two  triangles  ABC  and  DEF,  you  can  see  that  B =  E,  C =  F and  A =  D. That is, corresponding angles of these two triangles are equal. What can you say about their corresponding sides ? Note that

BC 3 0.6. EF 5   What about AB DE and CA FD ? On measuring AB, DE, CA and FD, you will find that AB DE and CA FD are also equal to 0.6 (or nearly equal to 0.6, if there is some error in the measurement). Thus, AB BC CA DE EF FD    You can repeat this activity by constructing several pairs of triangles having their corresponding angles equal. Every time, you will find that their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion). This activity leads us to the following criterion for similarity of two triangles.

Theorem 6.3 : If  in  two  triangles,  corresponding  angles  are  equal,  then  their corresponding  sides  are  in  the  same  ratio ( or  proportion ) and  hence  the  two triangles  are  similar.

This criterion is referred to as the AAA (Angle-Angle-Angle)  criterion  of similarity of two triangles.

This theorem can be proved by taking two triangles  ABC  and  DEF  such  that  A =  D,  B =  E and  C =  F (see Fig. 6.24)

Cut DP = AB and DQ = AC and join PQ.

Remark : If two angles of a triangle are respectively equal to two angles of another triangle, then by the angle sum property of a triangle their third angles will also be equal. Therefore, AAA similarity criterion can also be stated as follows:

# PAGE 16

If two angles of one triangle are respectively equal to two angles of another triangle,  then  the  two  triangles  are  similar.

This may be referred to as the AA similarity criterion for two triangles.

You have seen above that if the three angles of one triangle are respectively equal  to  the  three  angles  of  another  triangle,  then  their  corresponding  sides  are proportional (i.e., in the same ratio). What about the converse of this statement? Is the converse true? In other words, if the sides of a triangle are respectively proportional to the sides of another triangle, is it true that their corresponding angles are equal? Let us examine it through an activity :

Activity 5 : Draw two triangles ABC and DEF such that AB = 3 cm, BC = 6 cm, CA = 8 cm, DE = 4.5 cm, EF = 9 cm and FD = 12 cm (see Fig. 6.25).

So, you have :

![Image](outputs/jemh106/jemh106_artifacts/image_000032_fbd2db70d5b9aedef45128cd6ac934454e7900956510f08d44a09a56704a7319.png)

Now measure  A,  B,  C,  D,  E  and  F.  You  will  observe  that  A =  D,  B =  E and  C =  F, i.e., the corresponding angles of the two triangles are equal.

You can repeat this activity by drawing several such triangles (having their sides in the same ratio). Everytime  you shall see that their corresponding angles are equal. It is due to the following criterion of similarity of two triangles:

Theorem 6.4 : If  in  two  triangles,  sides  of  one  triangle  are  proportional  to ( i.e., in the same ratio of ) the sides of the other triangle, then their corresponding angles are equal and hence the two triangles are similiar.

This criterion is referred to as the SSS (Side-Side-Side) similarity criterion for two  triangles .

This theorem can be proved by taking two triangles ABC and DEF such that

Cut DP = AB and DQ = AC and join PQ.

| Thus,                 |  ABC   DPQ (Why ?)                      |
| So,                   |  A =  D,  B =  E and  C =  F (How ?) |

Remark : You may recall that either of the two conditions namely, (i) corresponding angles are equal and (ii) corresponding sides are in the same ratio is not sufficient for two polygons to be similar. However, on the basis of Theorems 6.3 and 6.4, you can now say that in case of similarity of the two triangles, it is not necessary to check both the conditions as one condition implies the other.

Let us now recall the various criteria for congruency of two triangles learnt in Class IX. You may observe that SSS similarity criterion can be compared with the SSS congruency criterion.This suggests us to look for a similarity criterion comparable to SAS congruency criterion of triangles. For this, let us perform an activity.

Activity 6 : Draw two triangles ABC and DEF such that AB = 2 cm,  A = 50°, AC = 4 cm, DE = 3 cm,  D = 50° and DF = 6 cm (see Fig.6.27).

# PAGE 18

Here, you may observe that AB DE = AC DF (each equal to 2 3 ) and  A (included between the sides AB and AC) =  D (included between the sides DE and DF). That is, one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of another triangle and sides including these angles are in the same ratio (i.e., proportion). Now let us measure  B,  C,  E and  F.

You will find that  B =  E and  C =  F. That is,  A =  D,  B =  E and  C =  F. So, by AAA similarity criterion,  ABC ~  DEF. You may repeat this activity by drawing several pairs of such triangles with one angle of a triangle equal to one angle of another triangle and the sides including these angles are proportional. Everytime, you will find that the triangles are similar. It is due to the following criterion of similarity of triangles:

Theorem 6.5 : If  one  angle  of  a  triangle  is  equal  to  one  angle  of  the  other triangle  and  the  sides  including  these  angles  are  proportional,  then  the  two triangles  are  similar.

This criterion is referred to as the SAS (Side-Angle-Side) similarity  criterion  for  two triangles .

As before,  this  theorem  can be proved by taking two triangles ABC and DEF such that

AB AC DE DF  (  1) and  A =  D (see Fig. 6.28). Cut DP = AB, DQ = AC and join PQ.

Solution : Let AB denote the lamp-post and CD the girl after walking for 4 seconds away from the lamp-post (see Fig. 6.32).

From the figure, you can see that DE is the shadow of the girl. Let DE be x metres.

In this chapter you have studied the following points :

1. Two figures having the same shape but not necessarily the same size are called similar figures.
2. All the congruent figures are similar but the converse is not true.
3. Two polygons of the same number of sides are similar, if (i) their corresponding angles are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (i.e., proportion).
4. If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle to intersect the other two sides in distinct points, then the other two sides are divided in the same ratio.
5. If a line divides any two sides of a triangle in the same ratio, then the line is parallel to the third side.
6. If in two triangles, corresponding angles are equal, then their corresponding sides are in the same ratio and hence the two triangles are similar (AAA similarity criterion).
7. If in two triangles, two angles of one triangle are respectively equal to the two angles of the other triangle, then the two triangles are similar (AA similarity criterion).



# PAGE 26

8. If in two triangles, corresponding sides are in the same ratio, then their corresponding angles are equal and hence the triangles are similar (SSS similarity criterion).
9. If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of another triangle and the sides including these  angles  are  in  the  same  ratio  (proportional),  then  the  triangles  are  similar (SAS similarity criterion).

## A NOTE TO THE READER

If in two right triangles, hypotenuse and one side of one triangle are proportional to the hypotenuse and one side of the other triangle, then  the  two  triangles  are  similar.  This  may  be  referred  to  as  the RHS Similarity Criterion.

If you use this criterion in Example 2, Chapter 8, the proof will become simpler.
