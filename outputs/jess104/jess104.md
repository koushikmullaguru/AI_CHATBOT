India is an agriculturally important country. Two-thirds of  its  population  is  engaged  in agricultural activities. Agriculture is a primary activity, which produces most of the food that we  consume.  Besides  food  grains,  it  also produces raw material for various industries.

Can  you  name  some  industries  based  on agricultural raw material?

Moreover, some agricultural products like tea, coffee, spices, etc. are also exported.

## TYPES OF FARMING

Agriculture is an age-old economic activity in our  country.  Over  these  years,  cultivation methods have changed significantly depending upon  the  characteristics  of  physical environment, technological  know-how and socio-cultural practices. Farming varies from subsistence to commercial type. At present, in  different  parts  of  India,  the  following farming systems are practised.

## Primitive Subsistence Farming

This type of farming is still practised in few pockets  of  India.  Primitive  subsistence agriculture is practised on small patches of land with the help of primitive tools like hoe, dao  and  digging  sticks,  and  family/ community labour.  This  type  of  farming depends upon monsoon, natural fertility of the soil and suitability of other environmental conditions to the crops grown.

It  is  a  'slash  and  burn'  agriculture. Farmers clear a patch of land and produce cereals and other food crops to sustain their family. When the soil fertility decreases, the farmers shift and clear a fresh patch of land for  cultivation. This type of shifting allows Nature to replenish the fertility  of  the  soil through natural processes; land productivity in this type of agriculture is low as the farmer does  not  use  fertilisers  or  other  modern inputs.  It  is  known  by  different  names  in different parts of the country.

Can you name  some such types of farmings?

It is jhumming in north-eastern states like Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland; Pamlou in Manipur, Dipa in Bastar district of  Chhattishgarh,  and  in  Andaman  and Nicobar Islands.

Jhumming: The 'slash and burn' agriculture is known as 'Milpa' in Mexico and Central America, 'Conuco' in Venzuela, 'Roca' in Brazil, 'Masole' in Central Africa, 'Ladang' in Indonesia, 'Ray' in Vietnam.

In India, this primitive form of cultivation is  called  'Bewar'  or  'Dahiya'  in  Madhya Pradesh, 'Podu' or 'Penda' in Andhra Pradesh, 'Pama Dabi' or 'Koman' or Bringa' in Odisha, 'Kumari' in Western Ghats, 'Valre' or 'Waltre' in  South-eastern  Rajasthan,  'Khil'  in  the Himalayan belt, 'Kuruwa' in Jharkhand, and ' Jhumming' in the North-eastern region.

Rinjha lived with her family in a small village at the outskirts of Diphu in Assam. She enjoys watching  her  family  members  clearing, slashing  and  burning  a  patch  of  land  for cultivation. She often helps them in irrigating the  fields  with  water  running  through  a bamboo canal from the nearby spring. She loves  the  surroundings  and  wants  to  stay here as long as she can, but this little girl has no idea about the declining fertility of the soil and her family's search for fresh a patch of land in the next season.

Can you name the type of farming Rinjha's family is engaged in?

Can you enlist some crops which are grown in such farming?

## Intensive Subsistence Farming

This type of farming is practised in areas of high population pressure on land. It is labourintensive  farming,  where  high  doses  of biochemical inputs and irrigation are used for obtaining higher production.

Can you name some of the states of India where such farming is practised?

Though the 'right of inheritance' leading to  the  division  of  land  among  successive generations has rendered land-holding size uneconomical, the farmers continue to take maximum output from the limited land in the absence of alternative source of livelihood. Thus,  there  is  enormous  pressure  on agricultural land.

## Commercial Farming

The main characteristic of this type of farming is the use of higher doses of modern inputs, e.g. high yielding variety (HYV) seeds, chemical fertilisers, insecticides and pesticides in order to obtain higher productivity. The degree of commercialisation of agriculture varies from one region to another. For example, rice is a commercial crop in Haryana and Punjab, but in Odisha, it is a subsistence crop.

Can you give some more examples of crops which may be commercial in one region and may provide subsistence in another region?

Plantation  is  also  a  type  of  commercial farming. In this type of farming, a single crop is grown on a large area. The plantation has an  interface  of  agriculture  and  industry. Plantations cover large tracts of land, using capital  intensive  inputs,  with  the  help  of migrant labourers. All the produce is used as raw material in respective industries.

In  India,  tea,  coffee,  rubber,  sugarcane, banana, etc., are important plantation crops. Tea  in  Assam  and  North  Bengal  coffee  in Karnataka  are  some  of  the  important plantation crops grown in these states. Since the production is mainly for market, a welldeveloped  network  of  transport  and communication connecting the plantation areas,  processing  industries  and  markets plays an important role in the development of plantations.

## CROPPING PATTERN

You have studied the physical diversities and plurality of cultures in India. These are also reflected  in  agricultural  practices  and cropping  patterns  in  the  country.  Various types of food and fibre crops, vegetables and fruits, spices and condiments, etc. constitute some of the important crops grown in the country. India has three cropping seasons -rabi , kharif and zaid .

Rabi crops are sown in winter from October to December and harvested in summer from April  to  June.  Some  of  the  important  rabi crops  are  wheat,  barley,  peas,  gram  and mustard. Though, these crops are grown in large  parts  of  India,  states  from  the  north and north-western parts such as Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh are important for the production of wheat and other rabi crops. Availability of precipitation during  winter  months  due  to  the  western temperate cyclones helps in the success of these crops. However, the success of the green revolution in Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and parts of Rajasthan has also been an important factor in the growth of the abovementioned rabi crops.

Kharif crops are grown with the onset of monsoon in different parts of the country and these  are  harvested  in  September-October. Important crops grown during this season are  paddy,  maize,  jowar,  bajra,  tur  (arhar), moong, urad, cotton, jute,  groundnut  and soyabean. Some of the most important ricegrowing  regions  are  Assam,  West  Bengal, coastal regions of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana,  Tamil  Nadu,  Kerala  and Maharashtra,  particularly the (Konkan coast) along with Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Recently, paddy has also become an important crop of Punjab and Haryana. In states like Assam, West Bengal and Odisha, three crops of paddy are  grown  in  a  year.  These  are Aus , Aman and Boro .

In between the rabi and the kharif seasons, there is a short season during the summer months known as the Zaid season. Some of the  crops  produced  during  'zaid'  are

CONTEMPORARY  INDIA - II

watermelon, muskmelon, cucumber, vegetables and fodder crops. Sugarcane takes almost a year to grow.

## Major Crops

A  variety  of  food  and  non  food  crops  are grown  in  different  parts  of  the  country depending upon the variations in soil, climate and cultivation practices. Major crops grown in India are rice, wheat, millets, pulses, tea, coffee, sugarcane, oil seeds, cotton and jute, etc.

Rice: It is the staple food crop of a majority of the people in India. Our country is the second largest  producer  of  rice  in  the  world  after China. It is a kharif crop which requires high temperature, (above 25°C) and high humidity with annual rainfall above 100 cm. In the areas of  less  rainfall,  it  grows  with  the  help  of irrigation.

Rice is grown in the plains of north and north-eastern India,  coastal  areas  and  the deltaic regions. Development of dense network of canal irrigation and tubewells have made it possible to grow rice in areas of less rainfall such as Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh and parts of Rajasthan.

Wheat: This  is  the  second  most  important cereal crop. It is the main food crop, in north and north-western part of the country. This rabi crop requires a cool growing season and a bright sunshine at the time of ripening. It requires 50 to 75 cm of annual rainfall evenlydistributed  over  the  growing  season.  There are two important wheat-growing zones in the country  -  the  Ganga-Satluj  plains  in  the north-west and black soil region of the Deccan. The  major  wheat-producing  states  are Punjab,  Haryana,  Uttar  Pradesh,  Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan.

Millets: Jowar,  bajra  and  ragi  are  the important millets  grown  in  India.  Though, these are known as coarse grains, they have very high nutritional value. For example, ragi is  very  rich  in  iron,  calcium,  other  micro nutrients and roughage. Jowar is the third most important food crop with respect to area and production. It is a rain-fed crop mostly grown in the moist areas which hardly needs irrigation. Major Jowar producing States are Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.

Bajra  grows  well  on  sandy  soils  and shallow  black  soil.  Major  Bajra  producing States  are  Rajasthan,  Uttar  Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Haryana. Ragi is a crop of dry regions and grows well on red, black, sandy, loamy and shallow black soils. Major ragi producing states are: Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Jharkhand and Arunachal Pradesh.

Maize: It  is  a  crop  which  is  used  both  as food  and  fodder.  It  is  a  kharif  crop  which requires temperature between 21°C to 27°C and grows well in old alluvial soil. In some states like Bihar maize is grown in rabi season also.  Use  of  modern  inputs  such  as  HYV seeds,  fertilisers  and  irrigation  have contributed to the increasing production of maize.  Major  maize-producing  states  are Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

Pulses: India is the largest producer as well as the consumer of pulses in the world. These are the major source of protein in a vegetarian diet. Major pulses that are grown in India are tur (arhar), urad, moong, masur, peas and gram. Can you distinguish which of these pulses are grown in the kharif season and which are grown in the rabi season? Pulses need less moisture and survive even in dry conditions. Being leguminous crops, all these crops  except  arhar  help  in  restoring  soil fertility  by  fixing  nitrogen  from  the  air. Therefore, these are mostly grown in rotation with other crops. Major pulse producing states in  India    are  Madhya  Pradesh,  Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka.

## Food Crops other than Grains

Sugarcane:  It  is  a  tropical  as  well  as  a subtropical crop. It grows well in hot and humid climate with a temperature of 21°C to 27°C and an annual rainfall between 75cm. and 100cm. Irrigation  is  required  in  the regions of low rainfall. It can be grown on a

variety of soils and needs manual labour from sowing to harvesting.  India  is  the  second largest  producer  of  sugarcane  only  after Brazil. It is the main source of sugar, gur (jaggary), khandsari and molasses. The major sugarcane-producing  states  are  Uttar Pradesh,  Maharashtra,  Karnataka,  Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar, Punjab and Haryana.

Oil  Seeds:  In  2020  India  was  the  second largest producer of groundnut in the world after  China.  Different  oil  seeds  are  grown covering approximately 12 per cent of the total cropped area of the country . Main oil-seeds produced in India are groundnut, mustard, coconut,  sesamum (til),  soyabean,  castor seeds, cotton seeds, linseed and sunflower. Most of these are edible and used as cooking mediums. However, some of these are also used as raw material in the production of soap, cosmetics and ointments.

Groundnut is a kharif crop and accounts for about half of the major oilseeds produced in the country. Gujarat was the largest producer of groundnut followed by Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu in 2019-20. Linseed and mustard are rabi crops. Sesamum is a kharif crop in north and rabi crop in south India. Castor seed is grown both as rabi and kharif crop.

Tea:  Tea  cultivation  is  an  example  of plantation agriculture. It is also an important beverage crop introduced in India initially by the British. Today, most of the tea plantations are owned by Indians. The tea plant grows well  in  tropical  and  sub-tropical  climates endowed with deep and fertile well-drained soil, rich in humus and organic matter. Tea bushes require warm and moist frost-free

producing states are Assam, hills of Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri districts, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Apart from these, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Meghalaya, Andhra Pradesh and Tripura are also tea-producing states in the country . In 2020 India was the second largest producer of tea after China.

Coffee: Indian coffee is known in the world for  its  good  quality .  The  Arabica  variety initially brought from Y emen is produced in the country . This variety is in great demand all over the world. Initially its cultivation was introduced on the Baba Budan Hills and even today its cultivation is confined to the Nilgiri in Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

India is an important producer of pea, cauliflower, onion, cabbage, tomato, brinjal and potato.

## Non-Food  Crops

Rubber: It is an equatorial crop, but under special conditions, it is also grown in tropical and sub-tropical areas. It requires moist and humid climate with rainfall of more than 200 cm. and temperature above 25°C.

Rubber is an important industrial raw material. It is mainly grown in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andaman and Nicobar islands and Garo hills  of  Meghalaya.

List the items which are made of rubber and are used by us.

Fibre Crops: Cotton, jute, hemp and natural silk  are  the  four  major  fibre  crops  grown  in  India. The first  three  are  derived  from  the  crops  grown in  the  soil,  the  latter  is  obtained  from  cocoons  of the silkworms fed on green leaves specially mulberry.  Rearing  of  silk  worms  for  the production of silk fibre is known as sericulture.

Cotton: India is believed to be the original home of the cotton plant. Cotton is one of the  main  raw  materials  for  cotton  textile industry. India is second largest producer of cotton after China. Cotton grows well in drier parts of the black cotton soil of the Deccan plateau. It requires high temperature, light rainfall or irrigation, 210 frost-free days and bright sun-shine for its growth. It is a kharif crop and requires 6 to 8 months to mature. Major  cotton-producing  states  are-

Maharashtra,  Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.

Jute: It is known as the golden fibre. Jute grows well on well-drained fertile soils in the flood plains where soils are renewed every year. High temperature is required during the time of growth. West Bengal, Bihar, Assam, Odisha and Meghalaya are the major jute producing states. It is used in making gunny bags, mats, ropes, yarn, carpets and other artefacts.

## Technological  and  Institutional  Reforms

It was mentioned in the previous pages that agriculture has been practised in India for thousands of years. Sustained uses of land without  compatible  techno-institutional changes have hindered the pace of agricultural development. Inspite of development of sources of irrigation most of the farmers in large parts of the country still depend upon monsoon and natural  fertility  in  order  to  carry  on  their agriculture. For a growing population, this poses a serious challenge. Agriculture which provides livelihood for more than 60 per cent of its population, needs some serious technical and institutional reforms. Thus, collectivisation,  consolidation  of  holdings, cooperation and abolition of zamindari, etc. were given priority to bring about institutional reforms in the country after Independence. 'Land reform' was the main focus of our First Five Y ear Plan. The right of inheritance had already led to fragmentation of land holdings necessitating consolidation of holdings.

The laws of land reforms were enacted but the implementation was lacking or lukewarm. The Government of India embarked upon introducing agricultural reforms to improve Indian agriculture in the 1960s and 1970s. The Green Revolution based on the use of package technology and the White Revolution (Operation Flood) were some of the strategies initiated  to  improve  the  lot  of  Indian  agriculture. But,  this  too  led  to  the  concentration  of development in few selected areas. Therefore, in the 1980s and 1990s, a comprehensive land development programme was initiated, which included  both  institutional  and  technical

reforms. Provision for crop insurance against drought,  flood,  cyclone,  fire  and  disease, establishment of Grameen banks, cooperative societies and banks for providing loan facilities to the farmers at lower rates of interest were some important steps in this direction.

Kisan Credit Card (KCC), Personal Accident Insurance  Scheme  (PAIS)  are  some  other schemes introduced by the Government of  India for the benefit of the farmers. Moreover, special weather bulletins and agricultural programmes for farmers were introduced on the radio and television.  The  government  also  announces minimum support price, remunerative and procurement prices for important crops to check the exploitation of farmers by speculators and middlemen.

Collect  information  about  agriculture, horticulture, agricultural schemes, etc. from Farmers'  Portal website  https://farmer. gov.in/FarmerHome.aspx. Discuss about the benefits  of  the  information  available  on the portal.

## Bhoodan - Gramdan

Mahatma Gandhi declared Vinoba Bhave as his  spiritual  heir.  He  also  participated  in

Satyagraha  as  one  of  the  foremost satyagrahis. He was one of the votaries of Gandhi's concept of gram swarajya . After Gandhiji's  martyrdom,  Vinoba  Bhave undertook padyatra to spread Gandhiji's message covered almost the entire country. Once, when he was delivering a lecture at Pochampalli in Andhra Pradesh, some poor landless villagers demanded some land for their  economic  well-being.  Vinoba  Bhave could not promise it to them immediately but assured them to talk to the Government of India regarding provision of land for them if they undertook cooperative farming.

Suddenly, Shri Ram Chandra Reddy stood up  and  offered  80  acres  of  land  to  be distributed  among  80  land-less  villagers. This act was known as 'Bhoodan'. Later he travelled and introduced his ideas widely all over  India.  Some  zamindars,  owners  of many villages  offered  to  distribute  some villages among the landless. It was known as Gramdan . However, many land-owners chose to provide some part of their land to the  poor  farmers  due  to  the  fear  of  land ceiling  act.  This  Bhoodan-Gramdan movement initiated by Vinoba Bhave is also known as the Blood-less Revolution .
