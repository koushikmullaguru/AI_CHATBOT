## Reading CompRehension text i

Let's	now	read	the	story	of	a	bus	conductor	and	his	passengers with	a	dog.	The	story	is	written	by	A.G	Gardiner.

## All	about	a	Dog

It was a b itterly	cold	night,	and	even	at	the	far	end	of	the	bus	the east	wind	that	raved	along	the	street	cut	like	a	knife.	The	bus stopped	and	two	women	and	a	man	got	in	together	and	filled	the vacant	places.	The	young	woman	was	dressed	in	sealskin,	and carried	one	of	those	little	Pekinese	dogs	that	women	in	sealskin like	to	carry	in	their	laps.	The	conductor	came	in	and	took	the fares.	Then	his	eyes	rested	with	old	malice	on	the	beady	eyed toy	 dog.	 I	 saw	 trouble	 brewing.	 This	 was	 the	 opportunity	 for which	he	had	been	waiting	and	he	intended	to	make	the	most of	it.	I	had	marked	him	as	the	type	of	what	Mr.	Wells	has	called the	Resentful	Employee,	the	man	with	a	great	vague	grievance against	everything	and	a	particular	grievance	against	passengers who	came	and	sat	in	his	seat	while	he	shivered	at	the	door.

'You	must	take	that	dog	out,'	he	said	with	sour	venom.

'I	 shall	 certainly	 do	 nothing	 of	 the	 kind.	 You	 can	 take	 my name	and	address,'	said	the	woman,	who	had	evidently	expected the	challenge	and	knew	the	reply.

'You	must	take	the	dog	out-	that's	my	orders.'

'I	won't	go	on	the	top	in	such	weather.	It	would	kill	me,'	said the	woman.

'Certainly	not,'	said	her	lady	companion,	'You've	got	a	cough as	it	is.'

'It's	nonsense,'	said	her	male	companion.

The	conductor	pulled	the	bell	and	the	bus	stopped.	'This	bus doesn't	go	until	that	dog	is	brought	out.'	And	he	stepped	on	to the	pavement	and	waited.	It	was	his	moment	of	triumph.	He	had the	law	on	his	side	and	the	whole	bus	full	of	angry	people	under the	harrow.	His	embittered	soul	was	having	a	real	holiday.

The	storm	inside	rose	high	'Shameful!'	'He's	no	better	than a	German.'	'Why	isn't	he	in	the	army?'	'Call	the	police.	Let's	all report	him.'	'Let's	make	him	give	us	our	fares	back.'	Everybody was	on	the	side	of	the	lady	and	the	dog.

That	 little	 animal	 sat	 blinking	 at	 the	 dim	 lights	 in	 happy unconsciousness	 of	 the	 rumpus	 of	 which	 he	 was	 the	 cause. The	conductor	came	to	the	door,	'What's	your	number?'	said one,		taking	out	a	pocket-book	with	a	gesture	of	terrible	things. 'There's	my	number,'	said	the	conductor	imperturbably.	'Give us	our	fares	back.'	'You	can't	leave	us	here	all	night.'	'No	fares back,'	said	the	conductor.

Two	or	three	 passengers	 got	 out	 and	 disappeared	 into	 the night.	The	conductor	took	another	turn	on	the	pavement,	then went	and	had	a	talk	with	the	driver.	Another	bus,	the	last	on the	road,	sailed	by	indifferent	to	the	shouts	of	the	passengers	to stop,	'They	stick	by	each	other	the	villains,'	was	the	comment.

Someone	pulled	 the	 bell	 violently.	 That	 brought	 the	 driver round	to	the	door,	'Who's	conductor	of	this	bus?'	he	said	and paused	for	reply. 'None	coming,'	he	returned	to	his	seat,	and resumed	beating	his	arms	across	his	chest.	There	was	no	hope in	 that	 quarter.	 A	 policeman	 strolled	 up	 and	 looked	 in	 at	 the door.	An	avalanche	of	indignant	protests	and	appeals	burst	on him.	'Well,	he's	got	his	rules,	you	know,'	he	said.	'Give	your name	and	address.'	'That's	what	he's	been	offered,	and	he	won't take	it.'	'Oh,'	said	the	policeman,	and	he	went	away	and	took his	stand	a	few	yards	down	the	street,	where	he	was	joined	by two	more	constables.

And	still	the	little	dog	blinked	at	the	lights,	and	the	conductor walked	 to	 and	 fro	 on	 the	 pavement,	 like	 a	 captain	 on	 the quarterdeck	in	the	hour	of	victory.	A	young	woman,	whose	voice had	risen	high	above	the	gale	inside,	descended	on	him	with	an air	of	threatening	and	slaughter.	He	was	immovable	as	cold	as the	night,	and	as	hard	as	the	pavement.	She	passed	on	in	a	fury of	impotence	to	the	three	policemen,	who	stood	like	a	group	of statuary	on	the	street	watching	the	drama.	Then	she	came	back,

imperiously	beckoned	to	her	'young	man'	who	had	sat	a	silent witness	of	her	rage,	and	vanished.	Others	followed.	The	bus	was emptying.	Even	the	dashing	young	fellow	who	had	demanded	the number	and	who	had	declared	he	would	see	this	thing	through if	he	sat	there	all	night,	had	taken	an	opportunity	to	slip	away.

Meanwhile	 the	 Pekinese	 party	 was	 passing	 through	 every stage	as	of	resistance	to	abject	surrender.	'I'll	go	on	the	top.' said	the	sealskin	lady	at	last.	'You	mustn't.'	'I	will.'	'You'll	have pneumonia.'

'Let	 me	 take	 it.'	 (This	 from	 the	 man)	 'Certainly	 not.'	 She would	die	with	her	dog.	When	she	had	disappeared	up	the	stairs, the	conductor	came	back,	pulled	the	bell,	and	the	bus	went	on. He	 stood	 sourly	 triumphant	 while	 his	 conduct	 was	 savagely discussed	in	his	face	by	the	remnant	of	the	party.

Then	the	engine	struck	work,	and	the	conductor	went	to	help the	driver.	It	was	a	long	job	and	presently	the	lady	with	the	dog stole	down	the	stairs	and	re-entered	the	bus.	When	the	engine was	 put	 right,	 the	 conductor	 came	 back	 and	 pulled	 the	 bell. Then	his	eyes	fell	on	the	dog,	and	his	hand	went	to	the	bell-rope again.	The	driver	looked	around,	the	conductor	pointed	to	the dog,	 the	 bus	 stopped,	 and	 the	 struggle	 recommenced	 with	 all the	original	features	-	the	conductor	walking	the	pavement,	the driver	smacking	his	arms	on	the	box,	the	little	dog	blinking	at the	lights,	the	sealskin	lady	declaring	that	she	would	not	go	on the	top	and	finally	going.

'I've	got	my	rules,'	said	the	conductor	to	me	when	I	was	the last	passenger	left	behind.	He	had	won	his	victory,	but	felt	that he	would	like	to	justify	 himself	 to	 somebody.	 'Rules,'	 I	 said,' are	necessary	things,	but	there	are	rules	and	rules.	Some	are hard	and	fast	rules,	like	the	rules	of	the	road,	which	cannot	be broken	without	danger	to	life	and	limb.	But	some	are	only	rules for	guidance,	which	you	can	apply	or	wink	at,	as	common	sense dictates,	like	that	rule	about	the	dogs.	They	are	not	a	whip,	put in	your	hand	to	scourge	your	passengers	with,	but	an	authority for	an	emergency.	They	are	meant	to	be	observed	in	the	spirit, not	in	the	letter,	for	the	comfort	and	not	the	discomfort	of	the passengers.	You	have	kept	the	rule	and	broken	its	spirit.	You may	mix	your	rules	with	a	little	goodwill	and	good	temper.'	He took	it	very	well	and	when	I	got	off	the	bus	he	said	'Good	night'

quite	amiably.

## B.  The Passive

Compare	the	two	sentences	given	below:

Ramesh	painted	the	walls.

The	walls	were	painted	by	Ramesh.

The	 first	 sentence	 is	 in active form	 and	 the	 second sentence	is	in passive form . When	the	person	doing	the	action (Ramesh)	is	the	subject,	we	use	the	verb	in	the	active	voice. When	the	subject	is	what	the	action	is	directed	at	(the	walls), we	use	the	verb	in	the	passive	voice.	In	the	first	sentence,	we talked	about	Ramesh	but	in	the	second	sentence	we	talked about	what	happened	to	the	walls.

In	the	passive	sentence	we	use by+agent to	add	important information,	that	is by Ramesh. We	can	leave	out by+agent if it	does	not	provide	any	specific	information.

Example:

All	the	students	were	given	sweets	yesterday.

My	room	is	cleaned	everyday	in	the	morning.

A	large	number	of	films	on	wildlife	conservation	have	been	made.

## Use	 the	 words	 given	 below	 and	 frame	 sentences	 using the	passive	forms	of	the	verbs.

Examples:

- Rice	 /	 cultivate	 /	 Gangetic valley and coastal region. (Simple	Present)
- Rice	is	cultivated	in	Gangetic	valley	and	coastal	region.
- The	documents	 /	 sign	 /	 principal.	(Present	Perfect) The	documents	have	been	signed	by	the	principal.
- (a) Taj	Mahal	 /	 build	 /	 Shah	Jahan.	(Simple	Past)

- (b) Malaria	 virus	 /	 transmit	 /	 female	 Anopheles	 mosquito. (Simple	Present)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

- (c) The	case	 /	 solve	 /	 police	and	two	persons	arrest.	(Present Perfect)
