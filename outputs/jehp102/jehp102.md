In  this  chapter,  we  shall  discuss  the  effects,  both  shortterm and long-term, of physical activity on each of the major organ systems of human body. You are aware that a healthy individual is one who has a healthy mind in a healthy body. This  state  of  health  can  be  achieved  when  various  organ systems  of  the  body  function  in  harmony.  For  example, physical activities are based on motor movements and their co-ordination. The command for movements comes from the brain which is a part of the nervous system. The required energy for movements and other activities is obtained from food. Food is completely digested in the intestine, a part of digestive system. Food and oxygen reach all the parts of body through the action of heart, which is a part of the circulatory system. In fact, many organ systems of the body function as an integrated whole for healthy maintenance of the body.

You  have  already  studied  about  organ  systems  of  the human body in the previous science classes. In this chapter, the  organ  systems  have  been  discussed  in  relation  to  the effect of physical activities. It is a common experience that performance  in  any  event,  sports  or  otherwise,  depends upon  physical  health,  as  well  as,  mental  and  emotional health.  Development and maintenance of physical, mental and  emotional  health  specially  during  this  coronavirus (COVID-19) is therefore, very important.

## Organ SyStemS Of Human BOdy

Aggregates of cells constitute a tissue. Tissues of various kinds together  make  an  organ  and  many  organs  together  comprise an  organ  system.  Various  organ  systems  perform  different functions of the body necessary for wellbeing and healthy living. The organs which have a major role to play in the functioning of their respective system, such as, heart, lungs, liver and kidney

are  called  vital  organs.  Before  we  learn  about  the  impact  of physical activities on organ systems, let us review functioning of these systems.

## Organ  systems  for  movement  of  body  and  limbs: skeletal and muscular systems

When you walk, play, exercise, practice or participate in a sport, or even when you 'warm up' prior to a sport activity or  competition,  what  is  most  obvious  are  the  movements of  hands  and  legs,  with  the  brain  being  equally  active. All the movements are due to contraction of muscles. Muscles are attached to bones. Bones form the skeleton. Bones are attached to each other by ligaments and muscles are attached to bones by tendons (Fig. 2.1, 2.2, 2.3).

Muscles  are  made  up  of  muscle  cells  which  are  also termed  as  muscle  fibres  because  of  their  elongated  shape. You have learnt in earlier classes that there are mainly three kinds of muscles. There are muscles that contract to cause movements according to one's will. These are called voluntary muscles,  such  as,  those  of  the  limbs  and  the  neck.  The involuntary  muscles,  such  as,  those  lining  the  food  canal, move automatically without our efforts for making them move. Another kind of muscles, which are also involuntary, are the muscles  of  the  heart  or  cardiac  muscles  which  never  stop contracting and relaxing. As learnt in earlier classes, muscle cells (muscle fibres) may be striated (voluntary) muscle fibres, unstriated  (involuntary)  muscle  fibres  and  cardiac  muscle fibres (Fig.2.4). Muscles are grouped into bundles enclosed in a membrane. Movement of muscles takes place by the movement of molecules of muscle proteins, called actin and myosin present in the muscle fibres. Upon receiving instructions from the brain and nerves, these proteins slide over each other and the muscle contracts.  Muscle  contraction  uses  up  energy,  which  comes from food. It is measured in calories.

## Energy producing organ systems

Through digestive  system,  food  gets  digested  and converted  to  a  form,  which  can  be  broken  down in  the  cell  to  release  energy.  Respiratory  system ensures a continuous supply of Oxygen to each and every cell of the body for oxidation of food. It is also responsible  for  continuous  elimination  of  carbon dioxide produced as a result of this oxidation.

Digested food (Glucose) + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water + ATP

Adenosine Tri Phosphate (ATP) is the chemical that releases energy. ATP is biological energy.

Respiratory  system  functions  to  ensure  the continuous  supply  of  oxygen  to  the  body  and removal of carbon dioxide from the body. Fig. 2.5 shows the different parts of the respiratory system. The intake of oxygen laden air from the atmosphere into lungs is inspiration (inhalation) and the

process of removal of CO 2 laden air from lungs is expiration (exhalation). Inspiration and expiration constitute breathing. (Fig. 2.7)

You  have  already  learnt  in  earlier  classes  that  when muscles of rib cage and diaphragm (the muscular partition between  thorax  and  abdomen)  contract  and  flatten,  the thoracic  cavity  increases  in  volume  and  air  from  outside rushes in. It passes through nostrils, pharynx, trachea and bronchi  and  reaches  the  lungs  (inhalation).  The  reverse happens  during  exhalation  when  muscles  of  the  rib  cage and diaphragm relax and CO 2 laden air from lungs goes out through bronchi, trachea and nostrils.

Breathing is followed by internal respiration when oxygen laden air from alveoli or air sacks of lungs is picked up by capillaries and reaches the heart through pulmonary vein. Once oxygen reaches cells, it oxidises glucose (which reaches cells after digestion through blood) to release energy as ATP or adenosine tri phosphate.

Circulatory system circulates nutrients and oxygen to all parts of the body. It also carries carbon dioxide and other waste substances produced in the body to organs (lungs and

![Image](outputs/jehp102/jehp102_artifacts/image_000010_e561a02f2a77187395356df081fb3d5a4f3fa49b78ac158239d9b5f630c08d5b.png)

kidneys) for their removal. It also transports hormones and minerals required for the body.

The flow chart below shows organs of circulatory system for you to recall.

## Organs of the circulatory system

![Image](outputs/jehp102/jehp102_artifacts/image_000011_e7a8976c660ef5258a7d352127a5a13ac34aff0052808f92b6ea61877c732429.png)

Heart  (Fig.  2.8)  is  the  most  vital  organ  of  the  body.  It  is situated  between the two lungs in the thoracic cavity and is a cone shaped muscular, four chambered organ covered by a membrane. The four chambers are left and right atria (singular  atrium)  and  left  and  right  ventricles.  They  are separated  by  muscular  partitions  called  septa  singular septum. The chambers communicate by openings which are protected by valves.

The cardiac muscle cells continuously contract and relax (heart beat) for pumping blood into the organs and receiving blood from them. As the heart beats, oxygenated blood flows into the arteries and goes to various parts of the body, and then it flows back to the heart through veins for oxygenation in  the  lungs.  This  circulation  of  blood  is  depicted  below. Blood  flow  between  heart  and  lungs  is  called  pulmonary circulation,  while  between  heart  and  body  parts  is  called systemic circulation.

The process of circulation is shown in Fig 2.10 and further elaborated below.

Fig. 2.9: Diagrammatic representation of the heart and the flow of blood through it

![Image](outputs/jehp102/jehp102_artifacts/image_000012_3d723fe82699ad0aea8a98d7c36e1f610ece139d64887eeae7eaab67957413a9.png)

## As shown in the above figure

- Deoxygenated blood from all parts of the body is collected by the veins. Veins pour deoxygenated blood laden with carbon dioxide into right atrium of the heart.

![Image](outputs/jehp102/jehp102_artifacts/image_000013_21a4cfcd49a6ad6afcedeea4e8461add34a4d03475f523ebece25127c9167665.png)

- From right  atrium,  deoxygenated  blood  goes  to  right ventricle and then through pulmonary artery to lungs.
- Pulmonary  vein  carries  (oxygenated  blood)  from  the lungs to the left atrium of the heart from where it goes to the left ventricle.
- Aorta, a large artery arises from left ventricle and the oxygenated  blood  enters  the  arteries  and  reaches  all the organs through them.

## Activity 2.2

In the diagram below, fill in the blanks with the words provided within brackets. In the upper boxes name the parts of the body from where blood is entering or going to and in the lower box state the kind of blood, oxygenated or deoxygenated.  After filling discuss with one of your classmates.

[Words: Lungs, upper part of body, lower part of body, all parts of body; +O2 (oxygenated) and -O2 (deoxygenated).]

Now you have understood that blood flows from various parts  of  the  body  to  heart,  heart  to  lungs,  lungs  to  heart and heart to various parts of the body. Since, in one circuit of circulation, blood passes through the heart twice, blood circulation  is  termed  double  circulation.  Regular  physical exercise has a positive effect on circulation. Hence, regular physical exercise is important for all.

## effectS Of PHySical activitieS, gameS, SPOrtS and yOga On muScular, circulatOry and reSPiratOry SyStemS

Physical  exercise  and  Yoga,  when  regularly  done,  have  a positive effect on the body, as explained below.

## Effects  of  physical  activities  on  vital  organs  and body functions

Weight  bearing  exercise  helps  preserve  bone  mass  and  thus protects against osteoporosis (bone degeneration).

# PAGE 7

## Muscles

Physical activity build and strengthen muscles, which can protect the bones from injury, support and protect joints from being affected by arthritis. Strong muscles also give stability and improve balance and coordination during movements. Physical activities also improve blood supply to the muscles and increase their capacity to use oxygen.

## Muscles and muscle performance

Physical  activities  if  undertaken  regularly  have  beneficial effects on the muscular system. Whenever physical activities, games or sport are undertaken there is contraction of muscles and increase in energy level due to breakdown of ATP.

The  beneficial  effects  of  regular  physical  activities  are listed below -

- Change in shape and size of the muscle fibres: Muscle fibres enlarge with physical activities which cause an overall  enlargement  of  muscles  with  the  change  in its  size  and  shape.  The  size  of  muscles  increases  by 60  per  cent.    It  is  because  of  this  reason  that,  the muscles of arms of a tennis player are well developed.
- Maintenance  of  muscle  tone: Muscles  are  stimulated to contract by signals from nerves. Due to continuous signals, when  physical exercises are undertaken, muscles remain in partial  state  of  contraction  called muscle tone. Hence, regular physical activities maintain good muscle tone and enhance physical fitness.
- Increase  in  muscle  proteins: The  units of  muscle contraction  are  proteins.  Physical  activities  lead  to increase in total proteins.
- Increase in blood capillaries: Regular physical exercises lead to increase in number of blood capillaries supplying blood to muscles.
- Increase in efficiency of ligaments and tendons: Ligaments  and  tendons  become  more  efficient  as  a result of regular physical activity. This improves muscle movements  resulting  in  greater  tolerance  of  stress during strenuous activity.
- Long term increase in muscle strength: Regular physical exercises increase and maintain strength of muscles. This increases speed of contraction as in the case of marathon runner and also work well against load as in the case of weight lifter.
- Delay  in  muscle  fatigue: Muscles  need  oxygen  to contract. But when muscles are used for a long time during  sport,  available  oxygen  gets  used  up  and lactic  acid  accumulates.  This  causes  muscle  fatigue. It is, therefore, important to do physical activities like stretching to delay muscle fatigue.

- Maintaining correct posture and beautiful body: Regular physical activities and yogic activity like asanas prevent postural deformities. Healthy muscles give the body a beautiful shape.

## Oxygen Debt

During  physical  activities,  respiratory  rate  increases.    At  the same time, oxygen gets speedily used up, this creates an oxygen debt, as the rate of oxygen intake may not match the oxygen requirement due to the exercise. Thus, maximum exercises are followed by a recovery period when oxygen debt is removed by obtaining more oxygen.  For example, when an athlete is running and requires 3 litres of oxygen, if oxygen obtained is only 2 litres, oxygen debt of 1 litre is created, which gets recovered during recovery period.

- Overall improvement in efficiency of muscle movements and  reaction time: Muscles contract on receiving stimulus from nerves. The time taken to react to the stimuli (reaction time) improves with regular physical exercise.
- Increase in capacity for storage of food: Regular physical activities help cells to store more food, which can be readily available for oxidation to provide energy when needed.

## Respiratory system

- Increase in size of lungs and volume of chest: Physical activities require more oxygen. Therefore, more oxygen has to be inhaled. This provides exercise to the lungs and chest and as a result  the  size  increases.    Simultaneously, the diaphragm and rib muscles strengthen.
- Increase  in  lung  power:  Respiratory  exercises,  which include  Pranayam  and  Anulom-vilom,  improve  lung power. The efficiency of alveoli or air sacs of lungs also improves.
- Activation of unused (inactive) alveoli: Active inhalation increases  residual  volume  of  air,  tidal  air  and  vital capacity which is important for healthy body.

Residual  volume  of  air: Even  after  forced  expiration  some  air remains in the lung, it cannot be expelled and is called residual air.

Vital capacity: Vital capacity is the amount of air inhaled and exhaled with maximum effort. In normal adult, it is 3500 cc to 4500 cc.

## Vital Capacity = TV + IRV + ERV

(TV= Tidal Volume, IRV =Inspiratory Reserve Volume, ERV=Expiratory Reserve Volume)

TV: The volume of air breathed in and out during quiet breathing is called tidal volume.

# PAGE 9

IRV: Air  over and above tidal volume that can be breathed in upon continuous inhalation.

ERV: Air  breathed  out  over  and  above  TV  upon  continuous exhalation.

Exercising regularly makes vital capacity go upto 5500cc.

## Circulatory system

Blood pumped into circulation transports oxygen and food to  tissues,  removes  waste  and  also  transports  hormones to  target  organs.  During  physical  activities,  nutrients  and Oxygen is needed by muscles to get energy for contraction. So heart pumps at a faster rate and circulation is speeded up. But this change is temporary. Certain permanent changes also occur when physical activities are undertaken regularly. These are given below.

- Increase in the size of heart occurs as cardiac muscles develop with regular physical activities. Regular exercise  increases  the  capacity  and  thickness  of  the walls of the heart.
- Increase  in number  of  capillaries and  blood  cells: The  unused  capillaries  become  active  with  physical activities  making  circulation  efficient.  An  increase  in the number of blood cells and amount of hemoglobin has also been observed.
- Decrease  in  heart  rate: Under  normal  conditions  the heart beats 72 times per minute at rest. But an athlete's heart rate may be found to be much lower at rest.  The athlete's heart becomes so efficient that at rest same requirement is fulfilled with fewer heartbeats.
- Increase in stroke volume: Stroke volume is the quantity of  blood  pumped  out  by  aorta  in  one  stroke.  Heart, having gained efficiency with regular physical activities, is able to pump out more blood in one stroke.

## Activity 2.3

## Activity 2.4

You have already studied asanas  in  your  previous class.  Write  the  names of asanas which can improve the -

- Respiration system
- Circulatory System
- Muscular system
- Decrease in LDL and increase in HDL: LDL and HDL are low density lipoproteins and high density lipoproteins respectively.  Lipoproteins  are  secreted  by  liver.  LDL, also  known  as  bad  cholesterol,  adversely  affects  the blood  vessels  of  the  heart.  On  the  other  hand,  HDL which is good cholesterol helps to remove cholesterol from  the  body.  Regular  physical  activities  help  in production of more HDL and less LDL Thus physical activities help in reducing blood cholesterol.
- Prevention  of  heart  related  illness/ailments: It  is  well known that cardiac diseases and high blood pressure can be prevented by regular physical exercises.

## effect Of yOga On tHe BOdy

Yogic practice ensures good health and enhances physical fitness. Some  of the asanas have been explained in Chapter  9.  It  has  been  found  that  these  asanas  develop muscles of the chest, abdomen and lungs and make them active. Some of you have already learnt this in Class IX.

Muscles of the rib cage are involved in respiration so the asanas indirectly improve respiration. Regular Yoga practice also improves blood circulation.

Apart from asanas, suryanamaskar is an integral part of yogic  practice.  Suryanamaskar  improves  blood  circulation and makes the lungs strong.
