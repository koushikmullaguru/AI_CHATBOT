## Foreword

Health of children is a major concern worldwide. Their health is very important  as  they  constitute  a  large  percentage  of  our  population. Many factors like physical, psychological, socio-economic and cultural influence our health, both in our day-to-day life and in the long run. The  involvement  of  all  children  in  physical  activities,  games  and sport, and yoga along with authentic knowledge is essential for their physical, emotional, social and mental development. In this endeavour, school education plays an important role. All the National Curriculum Frameworks have recommended health and physical education as an integral  part  of  the  school  curriculum.  With  this  view,  the  National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has prepared this textbook on Health and Physical Education for Class X.

This  textbook  focuses  on  the  holistic  understanding  of  physical education and its relationship with other subjects and the effects of physical activities on human body. It also provides a scope for children to learn the theoretical, as well as, the practical aspects of individual and team games. Further, it discusses yoga, dietary considerations, safety measures for healthy living, social health, agencies and awards promoting health, sports and yoga. The information about coronavirus (COVID-19), its modes of transmision and prevention have also been included at relevant places to help the children remain safe and healthy. Keeping in view the inter-related nature of the concepts covered in the area of Health and Physical Education, the presentation is made in a cohesive and an integrated manner rather than adopting a fragmentary approach. Experiential learning activities for acquiring skills for healthy living are made an integral part of the book.

The NCERT appreciates the efforts  of  the  Textbook  Development Committee. Several experts and teachers have contributed towards the finalisation of this book. We are grateful to them and their institutions. I am thankful to Professor Saroj Yadav, Dean (Academic) and the Project Coordinator of the National Population Education Project (NPEP) for her continuous  efforts  in  developing  this  material  and  bringing  it  to  its present from.

As an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement  in  the  quality  of  our  products,  the  NCERT  welcomes comments  and  suggestions  from  teachers  and  students,  which  will enable us to undertake further revision and refinement.

The students can correlate the given activities in the textbook with their day-to-day life.
