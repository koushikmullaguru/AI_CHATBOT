Track and field events, as one of the major individual sports, have already been studied in the previous chapter. However there are other individual sports like Badminton, Gymnastics, Table Tennis, Tennis, Swimming and Combative Sports such as Judo and Boxing. We shall discuss these games in this chapter.

## Badminton

Badminton is a racket sport played by either two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles). The players take positions on opposite halves of a rectangular court that is divided by a net. It is one of the few sports where men and women can play together.  It is a game for all ages and abilities. Although fitness is a key aspect for professional players, it is also played as a recreation game across the world.

## History

The origin of the badminton dates back to second century BC.  Although  it  appears  that  this  sport  was  named  after Badminton  House,  Gloucestershire,  owned  by  the  Duke of  Beaufort.  In  1873,  some  British  army  officers  in  India initially played the game at 'Poonah' (now known as Pune) thus derived its name. In 1877 first set of rules were derived. These laws were gradually adopted by other nations. However, the  game  evolved  as  an  international  sport  only  after  the first All England Championship. In 1934, the International Badminton  Federation  (now  known  as  Badminton  World Federation)  was  formed  and  the  rules  of  the  game  were standardized.  Badminton  Association  of  India  came  into existence in the year 1934. Various state level associations are affiliated to it.

## Events

The  events  played  in  badminton  are:  (a)  Singles'  (Men, Women),  (b)  Doubles'  (Men,  Women),  (c)  Mixed  Doubles' (Combination of one Man and one Woman) and (d) Teams' Event (Men, Women, Mixed)

## Court

The court is rectangular, and is divided into 2 halves by a net. Court is usually marked for both singles' and doubles' play. The doubles' court is wider than the 'singles' court.

The full width of the court is 6.1 metres, and in singles' this width is reduced to 5.18 metres. The full length of the court  is  13.4  metres.  The  service  courts  are  marked  by  a centre line dividing the width of the court, by a short service line at a distance of 1.98 metres from the net, and by the outer  side  and  back  boundaries.  In  doubles',  the  service court is  also  marked by a long service line, which is 0.76 metres from the back boundary.

The net is 1.55 metres high at the edges and 1.524 metres high in the centre. The net posts are placed over the doubles sidelines, even when singles is played.

## Rules

## Starting the game

A coin is tossed to start the game. The player winning the toss has the choice to serve first, or to choose which side of the court would they prefer. The player losing the toss gets the left over option.

## Service

- At the beginning of the game of badminton and when the  score  is  even,  the  server  serves  from  the  right service court.
- Server and receiver always stand diagonally in opposite service courts.
- The  server's  racket  shall  initially  hit  the  base  of  the shuttle.
- While serving the whole of the shuttle shall be below 1.15m from the surface of the court at the instant of impact of the racket with the shuttle.
- Some parts of both feet of the server and receiver must remain in contact with the surface of the court until service is delivered.
- The  movement  of  the  server's  racket  must  continue forward after  the  start  of  service  until  service  is  delivered.

## Let

'Let' is  called by the umpire, or by a player (if there is no umpire), to halt play. A 'let' may be given for any unforeseen or accidental occurrence. It shall be a 'let', if -

- there is an unforeseen or accidental situation occurs.
- during play, the shuttle is caught in the net or caught on  the  net  and  remains  suspended  on  its  top  after passing over the net.
- the shuttle disintegrates and the base separates from the rest of the shuttle.
- the  server  and  receiver  are  both  faulted  at  the  same time.
- the server serves before the receiver is ready.
- the line judge is unsighted and the umpire is unable to make a decision.
- in the opinion of the umpire, the play is disrupted or a player of the opposing side is distracted by a coach.

## Faults

A player or player's side loses the rally, if the service or shuttle -

- is not correct.
- misses the shuttle during service.
- lands outside the court.
- passes through the net.
- fails to cross over the net.
- touches  the  walls  or  ceiling  or  ground  before  being retrieved.
- is hit twice.

- hits a player, attire, equipment or any person or object outside the court.
- is hit by both the doubles partners in succession.
- is in play, the player's racket, parts of his body or his clothes touch the net or its support.

## Fundamental techniques

1. Grip: Holding  grip  of  a  badminton  racket  is  the foundation of playing this game. Holding the racket wrongly  will  reduce  the  power  and  accuracy  of  the stroke. The shots will be limited. A player needs to learn how to change grip quickly during games. Below are the two basic types of badminton grips.

## Forehand grip

- This grip is used to hit shots on the forehand side of the body and around the head shots.
- In this a player holds the racket head in the non-playing hand, keeping the handle points towards the body. The face of the racket perpendicular to the floor.
- The  player  places  the  playing  hand  on  the  handle just like shaking hands with it, it is like a V shape in between thumb and index finger.
- For flexibility, the racket handle rest loosely in the fingers.
- In order to increase control and accuracy while serving and hitting from the forecourt and mid court, the grip is shortened and placed nearer to the shaft.

## Backhand grip

- While playing backhand grip, shots is hit from backhand (left) side of player's body.
- The player holds the racket in the same way as it was held in forehand grip.
- The player turns the racket anti-clockwise so that the V shape moves leftwards.
- The player places the thumb against the back of the handle for greater leverage and power.
- The other techniques are the same as in forehand grip.
2. Service: There are basically three types of serves high, low and flat. High service is the most basic of all  strokes.  One  needs  to  learn  this  first  when  one starts playing the game. You need to concentrate on the following three broad points while delivering the high service.
- Stance: To deliver the high service, the player has to take a position about two feet from the short service line and about six inches from the centre line.
- The  player  has  to  make  sure  not  to  touch  the centre line as it will be called a touch fault. The player  has  to  stand  comfortably  with  both  feet spread apart and parallel to each other and take the initial serving position. At this stage, the full weight of the body is on the back foot.
- Point  of  Contact:  As  one  starts  the  forward movement of the racket, slowly start shifting the weight from the back foot to the front foot. The player then drops the shuttle and hit it high and

# PAGE 6

- back to the baseline. The player must make sure that the point of contact is always below the waist.
- Follow-through: Once the service is delivered, the player continues to swing the racket right across the left shoulder (or right shoulder if the player is left-handed). This is called the follow through.
3. Return of Service: This stroke plays a crucial part in a rally because good return of serve allows a player to dictate terms and control a rally till the point is won. However weak return of serve will allow the opponent to go on the offensive. While receiving the serve to hit the shuttle, normally players stand in the centre of the court with the left foot forward and place the weight of  the  body  more  on  the  front  foot.  It  will  help  the player to receive all types of serves i.e. high, low and flick. In fact, players are advised to take the stance closer to the short service because in high serve the shuttle remains in the air for a longer duration. On a  high  serve,  a  player  has  the  choice  of  playing  an attacking clear, drop shot, smash or a half smash. Similarly, on a low serve, a player can flick, push or lift the shuttle to the baseline. It is important to try to meet the shuttle as close to the net as possible so that the receiver has more options available to choose the shots.

## Gymnastics

Gymnastics  is  a  sport  that  involves  physical  movements in a sequence.  It requires physical strength, balance, coordination,  endurance,  flexibility  and  body  control.  It often involves dance moves, flips, twists, jumps and other moves. It helps children to develop physical coordination and motor skills, proper use of balance develop a good sense of precision and timing. It can be performed as a way to stay fit or specifically to compete in events locally, nationally as well as internationally.

## History

Gymnastics was developed for fitness and beauty practices by  the  ancient  Greeks.  It  included  skills  for  mounting and dismounting a horse, and circus performance skills. The Greeks used gymnastics as military training. However, in  the  late  eighteenth  and  early  nineteenth  century,  the German  physical  educators  created  exercises  for  boys and young men on apparatus. Their design is considered as  modern  gymnastics.  The  Federation  of  International Gymnastics  was  founded  in  1881.  By  the  end  of  the

nineteenth  century,  men's  gymnastics  competition  was popular enough to be included in the first 'Modern' Olympic Games in  1896  and  women  gymnasts  were  included  in Olympic Games in 1986. The first world cup in gymnastics was organised in 1975.

## Forms of gymnastics

The  major  forms  of  gymnastics  are:  Artistic  gymnastics, Rhythmic gymnastics, Trampolining, Tumbling and Acrobatic Gymnastics.

## Artistic gymnastics

Artistic gymnastics is usually divided into Men's and Women's Gymnastics.  Men  compete  in  six  events.  These  are  floor exercise,  pommel  horse,  still  rings/roman  rings,  vaulting table, parallel bars, and horizontal bar. Women compete on four events. These are floor exercise, vaulting table, uneven bars, and balancing beam.

## 1. Events for men

- (i)  Floor  Exercise:  For  this  event  a  12×12  square spring  floor  is  required.  A  series  of  tumbling passes  are  performed  to  demonstrate  flexibility, strength,  and  balance.  The  gymnast  must  also show strength skills, including circles, scales, and press  handstands.  Men's  floor  routines  usually have  four  passes  that  will  total  between  50-70 seconds and are performed without music. As per rules,  male  gymnasts  touch  each  corner  of  the floor at least once during their routine.
- (ii)  Pommel  Horse:  A  typical  pommel  horse  exercise involves  both  single  leg  and  double  leg  skills. Single leg skills are generally found in the form of scissors, often done on the pommels. Double leg skill,  however,  is  the  main  staple  of  this  event. The gymnast swings both legs in a circular motion (clockwise or counterclockwise depending on preference) and performs such skills on all parts of  the  apparatus.  Gymnasts  will  often  include variations on a typical circling skill by turning or by straddling their legs.  This makes the exercises of gymnast more challenging. A gymnast performs a dismount, either by swinging his body over the horse or landing after a handstand.
- (iii)  Still Rings: The rings are attached to a wire cable from a point to 5.75 meters from the floor, and adjusted in height so, that the gymnast has room to hang freely and swing. The gymnast performs a

![Image](outputs/jehp105/jehp105_artifacts/image_000011_f555375cddeefb6b58665754b38e9cb84823c3d972508001b930d9dac06928f9.png)

# PAGE 8

- routine demonstrating balance, strength, power, and  dynamic  motion  while  preventing  the  rings themselves  from  swinging.  At  least  one  static strength  move  is  required,  but  some  gymnast includes two or three strenghts. A routine should have a dismount at the end of routine.
- (iv)  Vault: In this, the gymnasts sprint down a runway, which is a maximum of 25 meters in length, before hurdling onto a spring board. The body position is maintained while 'punching' (blocking using only a shoulder movement) the vaulting board. The gymnast then rotates to a standing position. Multiple twists and somersaults are added before landing in case of advance gymnastics. Vaults depend on the speed of the run, the length of the hurdle, the power the gymnast generated from the legs and shoulder girdle and the kinesthetic awareness in the air. In case of more difficult and complex vaults the speed of rotation is more important.
- (v)  Parallel Bars: Men perform on  two  bars.  These  are kept  slightly  further  than a  shoulder's  width  apart and usually 1.75 m high. For executing a series of swings, balances, and releases require great strength and coordination.
- (vi)  Horizontal Bar: A 2.8 cm thick steel or fiberglass bar raised 2.5m above the landing area is all the gymnasts have to hold onto as they perform giants (revolutions around the bar), release skills, twists, and  changes  of  direction.  By  using  all  of  the momentum from giants and then releasing at the proper point, enough height can be achieved for spectacular dismounts. Leather grips are usually used to help maintain a grip on the bar.

## 2. Events for women

- (i)  Floor Exercise: The floor event occurs on a carpeted 12m × 12m square, usually consisting of hard foam over  a  layer  of  plywood,  which  is  supported  by springs or foam blocks generally called a 'spring' floor.  Female gymnasts perform a choreographed routine  of  50  to  70  seconds  in  this  event.  The routine should consist of tumbling lines, series of jumps, dance elements, acrobatic skills, and turns.

- (ii)  Vault:  In  the  vaulting  events  gymnasts  sprint down a 25 meters (82 ft) runway, jump onto or perform a round off entry onto a beat board or spring board, land momentarily, inverted on the hands  on  the  vaulting  horse  or  vaulting  table. Then they spring off this platform to a two footed landing. Every gymnast starts at a different point on the vault runway depending on her height and strength. The post flight segment may include one or  more  multiple  somersaults,  and/or  twisting movements.  In  vaults  with  round-off  entries, gymnasts  'round-off'  so  that  hands  are  on  the runway while the  feet  land  on  the  springboard. From the round-off position the gymnast travels backwards as in a back handspring so that the hands  land  on  the  vaulting  platform  (horse). She  then  blocks  off  the  vaulting  platform  into various twisting and somersaulting combinations.
- (iii)  Uneven Bars: On the uneven bars (also known as asymmetric bars), the gymnast performs a routine on two horizontal bars set at different heights. The height  is  generally  fixed,  but  the  width  may  be adjusted. Gymnasts  perform  swinging,  circling, transitional,  and  release  moves,  as  well  as  moves that pass through the handstand. Usually in higher levels of gymnastics, leather grips are worn to ensure that the gymnast maintains a grip on the bar, and to protect the hands from blisters and tears.
- (iv)  Balance Beam: The gymnast performs a choreographed  routine  from  70  to  90  seconds in  length  consisting  of  leaps,  acrobatic  skills, turns  and  dance  elements  on  a  padded  spring beam. Apparatus norms set by the International Gymnastics  Federation  specify  that  the  beam must be 125 cm (4') high, 500 cm (16') long, and 10 cm (4.5') wide. The event requires in particular, balance, flexibility and strength.

## 3. Rhythmic gymnastics

Only women compete in rhythmic gymnastics, although  there  is  a  new  version  of  this  discipline for  men  being  pioneered  in  Japan.  This  combines elements of ballet, gymnastics, dance and apparatus manipulation. The sport involves the performance of five separate routines with the use of five apparatus -  Ball,  Ribbon,  Hoop,  Clubs,  Rope  on  a  floor  area, with a much greater emphasis on the aesthetic rather than the acrobatic.

# PAGE 10

## 4. Acrobatic gymnastics

Acrobatic gymnastics is one of the oldest forms of organised physical activities, and  today  it  is  being  reorganised,  revitalised  by changes  and  renewed  interest.  The  International Federation of Sports Acrobatics (IFSA) was founded in Moscow in 1973. United States Sports Acrobatics (USSA)  was  founded  in  1975.    It  was  merged  with International  Gymnastics  federation  (FIG)  in  1999. Sports  Acrobatics  was  demonstration  sports  at  the 2000  Olympics  in  Sydney.  Now,  it  is  an  accepted competitive sport. It is very effective for the development of physical fitness and graceful posture. Acrobatic gymnastics is a group gymnastic discipline for both men and women. Acrobats in groups of two, three  and  four  perform  routines  with  the  heads, hands and feet of their partners. They may, subject to regulations (e.g. instrumental), pick their own music.

## 5. Tumbling and trampolining

Tumbling,  also  known  as  power  tumbling,  is  a gymnastics sporting discipline which combines skills of artistic gymnastics with those of trampolining. It is  sometimes  practiced  on  a  25-meter-long  spring track, competitors both male and female, perform two passes, each containing eight skills, along the track.

## taBle tennis

Table Tennis is also known as Ping-Pong, in which two or four players participate using table-tennis rackets on a plain hard surface called Table, which is divided by a net.

## History

The  game  of  Table  Tennis  probably  descended  from  the game of 'Royal  Tennis',  which  was  played  in  the  medieval era  (12th  century  A.D.)  Table  Tennis  was  probably  played with  improvised  equipment  in  England  during  the  last quarter of  19th  century.  Evidence  show  that  David  Foster in England patented an action game of Tennis on Table in 1890.  One  year  later  John  Jaques  came  out  with  a  game called Gossima. In 1900, a celluloid ball was introduced by Jaques and the name was given as 'Ping-Pong'. Table Tennis is controlled by ITTF (International Table Tennis Federation) which was founded in 1926 with headquarters in Berlin. It was introduced in Olympics in 1988 in Seoul, South Korea. First  World  Championship  of  Table-Tennis  was  held  in London in 1926. TTFI (Table-Tennis Federation of India) was formed in 1926 in Calcutta, now known as Kolkata.

## Rules

- Table  Tennis  table  is  9  ft.  (2.74  meter)  long,  5  ft. (1.525 meter) wide and 2.5 ft.(76 centimeter) high.
- Net is 6 inches (15 centimeter) high from the table.
- A game of Table Tennis is played up to 11 points.
- A  player  or  the  pair  who  first  scores  11  points  wins unless both players or pairs score 10 points then the game is won by the player or pairs who gains 2 point lead.
- If a player causes the table to move while the ball is in play, player loses a point.
- A player shall score a point if the opponent's free hand touches the playing surface or the net assembly.

## Fundamental techniques

1. Grip: Players grip their rackets in a variety of ways. The manner in which players grip their rackets can be classified into two major categories i.e. Pen hold grip (mainly used by Chinese and Korean) and shake hand or Orthodox grip (commonly used).
- Pen hold grip: In this, one grips the racket in such a way as one holds a pen. It involves index finger and  think  joining  each  other  across  the  handle and curling the middle, ring and fourth finger on the back of the blade. The three fingers however, will always remain touching one another.

- Shake hand grip:  In this grip, the racket is held in such a way as one shakes hand with someone. The shake hand grip is used due to increasingly fast  nature  of  the  game,  making  the  backhand stroke more effective.
2. Services: There are different kind, of services, such as, long service, short service, spin service, flat service, high toss service and back-hand or forehand service.
3. Types of strokes: The two types of strokes are offensive and  defensive  including  backhand  and  forehand.
- (i)  Offensive strokes (drive, loop drive, loop, loop kill, hook, counter drive, flip and smash)
- a)  Drive:  The  racket  is  primarily  perpendicular to the direction of the stroke, and most of the energy  applied  to  the  ball  results  in  speed rather  than  spin,  creating  a  shot  that  does not arc much, but it is fast enough to make it difficult to return.
- b)  Loop drive: The racket is much more parallel to the direction of the stroke (closed) and the racket thus grazes the ball, resulting in a large amount  of  topspin.  Variations  in  spin  and speed add to the effectiveness of this shot.
- c)  Loop: The loop produces a more pronounced loopy arc, with a higher trajectory and extreme topspin, but is typically slower.
- d)  Loop kill: The loop kill produces a flatter arc, with  higher  speed  that  resembles  a  speed drive but with stronger topspin.
- e)  Hook: It is similar to a regular Loop, but carries a tilted topspin (or is referred as the 'top-side' spin),  it  bounces  sideways  and  downward upon hitting the table.
- f)  Counter drive: It is a counter attack against drives  (normally  high  loop  drives).  One  has

- to bring close to the racket and stay close to the ball (try to predict its path). The racket is held closed and near to the ball, which is hit with a short movement off the bounce (before reaching  the  highest  point)  so  that  the  ball travels faster to the other side.
- g)  Flip: When a player tries to attack a ball that has not bounced beyond the edge of the table, however the ball may still be attacked, and the resulting shot is called flip because the back swing is compressed into a quick wrist action.
- h)  Smash:  Smash  is  executed  when  his  or  her opponent has returned a ball that bounces too high  and/  or  too  close  to  the  net.  Smashing is  a  large  back  swing  and  rapid  acceleration imparting as much speed on the ball as possible.
- (ii)  Defensive strokes
- a)  Push  or  Slice:  The  push  is  usually  used  for keeping the point alive and creating offensive opportunities. A push resembles a tennis slice, the racket cuts underneath the ball, imparting backspin and causing the ball to float slowly to the other side of the table. Offensive players should  only  push  for  variation  and  not  for general rallies.
- b)  Chop: A chop or cut is the defensive, backspin counterpart to the offensive loop drive. A chop is essentially a bigger, heavier slice, taken well back  from  the  table.  Sometimes  a  defensive player can impart no spin on the ball during a chop, or frequently add right- or left-hand spin to the ball. This may further confuse his/ her opponent.
- c)  Block: A block is executed by simply putting the racket in front of the ball, the ball rebounds back  toward  the  opponent  with  nearly  as much energy as it came in with. This is not as easy as it sounds, because the ball's spin, speed, and location, all influence the correct angle of a block.
- d)  Side spin drive: The premise of this move is to put a spin on the ball either to the right or the left  of  the  racket.  The  execution  of  this  move is  similar  to  a  slice,  but  to  the  right  or  left, instead of down. This spin will result in the ball curving to the side but bouncing in the opposite direction when the opponent returns it.

- e)  Lob: The defensive High Ball or Lob is deceptive in its simplicity. To execute a High Ball, a defensive player first backs off the table 8-10 meters; then, the stroke itself consists of simply lifting the ball to an enormous height before it falls back to the opponent's side of the table. A High Ball is inherently a creative shot, and can have nearly any kind of spin.
- f)  Drop shot: The drop shot is a high level stroke, used  as  another  variation  for  close-to-table strokes. The player has position the racket close to the ball and just let the ball touch it (without any hand movement) in a way that the ball stays close to the net with almost no speed and spin, and  touches  the  other  side  of  the  table  more than twice if the opponent doesn't reach it.

## Skills

## Forehand drive

- Keep arm close to the torso.
- Forearm makes 90° with the upper arm.
- Draw the forearm back to another 45°.
- Let  the  waist  turn  naturally  along  with  the  arm  and shift your weight towards the right foot.
- Swing  forward  with  a  slight  upward  motion  while shifting your weight back to left foot.
- Elbow should be used as a pivot point and should only move a little forward in the follow through.

## Backhand drive

- Form ready position.
- Turn waist towards left with Racket towards 9 O'clock position.
- Contact  with  the  ball  is  made  in  front  of  the  body slightly after the top of the bounce.

- Elbow acts as pivot point.
- Snap the forearm forward in slightly upward direction.
- Power comes with the flick of the wrist.
- Follow through until the racket points after the ball.

## Blocking

It is a backup shot, when there isn't enough time for a full drive or loop. This stroke allows the players to use opponent force against them.

- Adjust the racket angle according to the severity of top spin. More the spin, more one should close the racket.
- Involve a little backspin and follow through.
- Execute immediately after the bounce to keep control and speed.
- Hit the ball as it is rising off the surface of the table on your side using 50 per cent of the stroke action before hitting the ball and 50 per cent after hitting the ball.

## tennis

Tennis is one of the most popular individual sports in the world. In tennis, the player uses a racquet to hit a ball over a net into the opponent's court. The ball must be kept in play and can only bounce one time on the court surface and the

# PAGE 16

opponent must strike the ball back over the net. It is a sport usually played between two players (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles).

## History

An  early  version  of  Tennis  started  in  the  16th  century  in France  where  players  would  yell  'tenez'  when  starting  a game giving the game the name, Tennis. Later the game was refined in England in the 19th century as lawn tennis which resembled the sport played today. The world's oldest tennis tournament, the Wimbledon Championships were first played in  London in 1877. The comprehensive rules promulgated in 1924 by the International Lawn Tennis Federation, now known as the International Tennis Federation, have remained largely stable, one of the major changes being the addition of the tie-back system. The Davis Cup, an annual competition between men's national teams, dates to 1900. The analogous competition for women's national teams, the Fed Cup, was founded as the Federation Cup in 1963. There are four top tournaments  called  the  Grand  Slam  Tournaments,  these are Wimbledon, the US Open, the Australian Open, and the French Open.

## Rules

The following are the rules regarding equipment, balls, court, lines and scoring:

## 1. Equipment

- (i)  Racquets:  Tennis  racquet  must  adhere  to  the following guidelines -
- The  hitting  area,  composed  of  the  strings, must be flat and generally uniform.
- The frame of the hitting area may not be more than 29 inches in length and 12.5 inches in width.
- The entire racquet must be of a fixed shape, size,  weight,  and  weight  distribution.  There may not be any energy source built into the racquet.
- The  racquet  must  not  provide  any  kind  of communication, instruction or advice to the player during the match.
- (ii)  Balls:  Tennis  balls  are  of  hollow  rubber  with  a felt coating. Traditionally white, the predominant colour was gradually changed to optic yellow in the latter part of the 20th century to ensure better visibility.

## (iii)  Court

- Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface, usually grass or clay, a hard court of concrete and/or asphalt and occasionally carpet (indoor). The court is 78 feet (23.77 m) long, and 27 feet (8.23 m) wide for singles matches and 36 ft (10.97 m) for doubles' matches.
- Additional  clear  space  around  the  court  is required for players so as to reach over run balls.
- A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. The net is 3 feet 6 inches (1.07 m) high at the posts and 3 feet (91.4 cm) high in the center.

## (iv)  Lines

- The lines that delineate the width of the court are called the baseline (farthest back) and the service line (middle of the court).
- The short mark in the center of each baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the center mark.

# PAGE 18

- The outermost lines that make up the length are  called  the  doubles'  sidelines.  These  are the  boundaries  used  when  doubles  is  being played.
- The lines to the inside of the doubles' sidelines are the singles' sidelines and used as boundaries in singles' play. The area between a  doubles'  sideline  and  the  nearest  singles' sideline is called the doubles' alley, which is considered playable in doubles' play.
- The  line  that  runs  across  the  center  of  a player's side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side.
- All  the  lines  are  required  to  be  2  inches (51 mm) in width. The baseline can be up to 4 inches (100 mm) wide if so desired.

## (v)  Scoring

- The players (or teams) start on opposite sides of  the  net.  One  player  is  designated  as  the server, and the opposing player is the receiver.
- A  tennis  match  is  determined  through  the best of 3 or 5 sets. Women play 3 set matches, while men play 5 set matches. For men, the first player to win three sets wins the match, and for women, the first player to win two sets wins the match.
- A set consists of games, and a game, in turn, consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving.
- A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent.
- The running score of each game is described in  a  manner  peculiar  to  tennis:  scores  from zero  to  three  points  are  described  as  'love', '15', '30', and '40' respectively
- If  at  least  three  points  have  been  scored  by each player, making the player's score equal at 40 a piece, the score is not called out as '40-40', but rather as 'deuce'.
- If  at  least  three  points  have  been  scored  by each  side  and  a  player  has  one  more  point than the opponent, the score of the game is 'advantage' for the player in the lead.

## 2. Grip

A grip is a way of holding the racquet in order to hit shots during a match. There are three types of grip.

- i.    Forehand:  the  tennis  forehand  is  a  stroke  in which the inner side of the palm of the dominant hand that is holding the racket faces forward. The forehand stroke is made by swinging the racket across one's  body  in  the  direction  of  where  one wants to land the ball.
- ii.  Backhand:  The  backhand  is  a  tennis  stroke  in which one swings the racquet around one's body with the back of the hand preceding the palm.
- iii.  The Serve (Service): A serve in tennis is a shot to start a pint. A player will hit the ball with racquet so it will fall into the diagonally opposite service box without being stopped by the net. There are three types of serve -
- a)  Flat Serve
- b)  Slice Serve
- c)  Kick Serve
- A  game  point  occurs  in  tennis  whenever the  player  who  is  in  the  lead  in  the  game needs only one more point to win the game. The  terminology  is extended  to sets (set point), matches (match point), and even championships (championship point).
- A break point occurs if the receiver, not the sever,  has  a  chance  to  win  the  game  with the next point. Break points are of particular importance because serving is generally considered advantageous, with the server being expected to win games in which they are serving.
- A receiver who has one (score of 30-40), two (score  of  15-40)  or  three  (score  of  love-40) consecutive  chances  to  win  the  game  has break point, double break point or triple break point, respectively.
- If the leading player wins that game, the player wins  the  set  7-5.  If  the  trailing  player  wins the game, a tie-break is played. A tie-break, played under a separate set of rules, allows one player to win one more game and thus the set, to give a final set score of 7-6.
- In tournament play, the chair umpire announces  the  winner  of  the  set  and  the overall score.

## swimminG

Swimming is a water based sport where a person propels the body through the water by arms, known as strokes and legs that are called kicks and move progressively through water. It is a sport for all round development of the child. Swimming improves cardiovascular system and places minimum stress on joints. It employs major muscle groups of the body leading to a well-developed flexible muscular system. Swimming is also important for physical rehabilitation for people suffering from disabilities or those recovering from injuries.

## History

Swimming is a sport that was included in the first modern Olympic  Games  at  Athens  in  1896,  diving  events  were added in 1904 and women's competitions were recognised in  1912.  FINA  (Federation  International  de  Notation)  was formed at London Olympic in 1908 AD. National Swimming Association  of  India  was  founded  in  1949.  Swimming was one of the six  sports  at  the  First  Asian  Games  held at Delhi in 1951. The aquatic sport of swimming involves competition amongst participants to be the fastest over a given distance. Different distances are covered in different levels of competition.

## Rules

- A  swimmer  must  finish  the  race  in  the  same  lane. Swimming across another lane or interfering with the other shall disqualify the offender.
- During  a  turn  the  swimmer  shall  touch  the  end  of the pool.
- A swimmer should not walk.
- Any swimmer not participating in a race, who enters the water in which an event is being conducted before all swimmers shall be disqualified from the next scheduled race in the meet.

![Image](outputs/jehp105/jehp105_artifacts/image_000034_fca9e75433ddfbd677de5e7f9347ca6b78caddb8a0cad1b9208908738d18d1e9.png)

## Do You Know?

The current Olympic games contain freestyle events of 50m, 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, and 1500m; 100m and 200m events in each of backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly; 200m Individual Medley (that is, 50m butterfly, 50m backstroke, 50m breaststroke, and 50m freestyle); 400m Individual Medley (100m butterfly, 100m backstroke, 100m breaststroke, and 100m freestyle); and the Marathon 10km.

- There shall be four swimmers in each relay team. In relay  events,  the  team  of  swimmers  whose  feet  lose touch with the starting platform before the preceding teammate touches the wall shall be disqualified. Any relay team shall be disqualified from a race if a team member, other than the swimmer designated to swim that  length,  enters  the  water  when  the  race  is  being conducted, before swimmers of all teams have finished the race. The member of a relay team and their order of competing must be nominated before the race. Any relay team member may compete in a race only once.
- The  composition  of  a  relay  team  may  be  changed between the heats and finals of the event, provided that it is made up from the list of swimmers properly entered by  a  member  for  that  event.  Failure  to  swim  in  the order listed will result in disqualification. Substitutions may  be  made  only  in  the  case  of  a  documented medical emergency.
- Any swimmer having finished the race, or the stipulated distance in a relay event, must leave the pool as soon as  possible  without  obstructing  any  other  swimmer who  has  not  yet  finished  the  race.  Otherwise  the swimmer committing the fault or the relay team shall be disqualified.
- Should  a  foul  endanger  the  chances  of  success  of  a swimmer, the referees shall have the power to allow the swimmer to compete in the next heat or, should the foul occur in a final event or in the last heat, they may order it to be re-swim.

## Fundamental techniques

Techniques in swimming are strokes, starts and turns.

## Strokes

In  swimming  there  are  four  competitive  strokes  (Front Crawl, Back Crawl, Breast stroke and Butterfly stroke) being followed all over the world. All the above mentioned strokes have been learnt in the previous class.

All  four  competitive  strokes  are  to  be  started  in  the  competition by  using  the  technique  known  as  start.  The  swimmers emphasis  on  the  quickest  technique,  which  allows  him  a stronger  push  off  from  the  starting  position.  The  starting techniques,  popular  today,  are:  (i)  Grab  start  (ii)  Circular start (iii) Racings start (iv) Conventional start (v) Tuck start. The following sequence is followed; (i) Position on the block (ii) Take off (iii) Flight (position in air) (iv) Entry into the water

![Image](outputs/jehp105/jehp105_artifacts/image_000035_4781ab4054966ab45154163e778ea1ee270d6ac21cb77322c1cbe0faeef9de6e.png)

# PAGE 22

(v) Glide (vi) First stroke. However, backstroke uses almost a uniform technique, which does not have any special name and is known as backstroke start.

## Turns

During the race, the swimmer must take a turn from the end of the wall to complete the full distance. The swimmers try to use a technique that is quicker and gives a strong push off from the wall within the permissible rules of the stroke. The  various  turns  used  by  swimmers  are:  (i)  Simple  turn (ii) Throw away turn (iii) Summer Sault turn (iv) Flip turn (v) Roll over turn (vi) Breast stroke turn (vii) Butterfly turn. The following sequence is followed in the turn: (i) Approach to the wall (ii) Turn or touch (iii) Push off (iv) Glide (v) First stroke.

## Tactics

Swimming  is  an  individual  and  cyclic  sport.  It  is  highly competitive  with  the  application  of  science.  It  is  getting transformed from an art to science. Now, the importance is given to strategy and tactics for completing and pacing the race. In order to achieve the best performance, a swimmer must  learn  to  distribute  the  distance  economically  and thoughtfully  throughout  the  race.  Tactics  in  swimming during different races can be categorised in three different phase -  (i) Sprint races (ii) Middle distance races (iii) Long distance races

## Sprint races

The  50  m  race  or  the  sprint  race  depends  on  the  start, maintaining the speed and a good finish.

## Middle and Long distance races

In these races, the key word is to build endurance and speed. In  middle  and  long  distance  races,  the  swimmer  tries  to prevent building up high oxygen debt. Swimming at a very fast pace will accumulate a high level of oxygen debt early in the race and will experience an immediate drop in speed. Swimmer may sometimes prefer to begin faster than an ideal pace  and  attempt  to  get  out  in  front  avoiding  the  choppy waters. Some swimmers like to swim the strategy races in relation to the opponent.
