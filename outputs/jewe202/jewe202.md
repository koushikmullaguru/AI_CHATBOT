## Let's Begin

1.  You  have  read  the  story  about  Nelson  Mandela  in  your textbook, First Flight, and the struggle of the people of South Africa.  Mandela  draws  our  attention  to  the  meaning  and importance of freedom and leading a life with freedom.

He  states that freedom comes  with responsibilities. Discuss with your peers, how freedom and responsibilities go hand in hand.

Given below is a speech by Sardar Patel, one of the prominent figures of India's freedom struggle. This is one of the convocation speeches  delivered  by  him.  Read  the  speech  and  answer  the questions that follow.

## Sardar Patel's Call to Youth to build Character and be Disciplined

I must thank you for the affectionate and warm welcome which you have extended to me and for the love and regard which you

have shown me by conferring this honour to me. Gifts are of many kinds those achieved by one's own endeavour are good and  deserved,  but  no  gift  should  be  conferred  on  one  whose worthiness has not been tested. By selecting me without assuring yourself of my fitness for the gift, you have laid me under a heavy debt and, by your injunctions that I should continue to prove worthy of it throughout my life, you have imposed on me a very difficult obligation. At present, I cannot say anything because I

am bound by your love and affection; and, therefore, with your blessing and God's grace, I pray that I may prove worthy of it. Should I fail, the blame for my failure will be shared by you as well.

On  this  occasion,  I  wish  to  place  before  you  a  few thoughts  which  occur  to  my  mind  as  incidental  to  our hard-won freedom. We have now won our freedom. But just  as  I  am  doubtful,  if  I  deserved  the  honour  that you have done me, you have also to think whether you have done everything to deserve freedom that you have attained after such a bitter and sustained struggle.

There are people who think that having won freedom, there is nothing more to do about it. Freedom has come to  us  through  sacrifices.  Those  who  made  sacrifices tasted the fruit of their efforts and self-denials, but it is for those who are now enjoying freedom to taste its fruit. After the last World War, there is an all-round deterioration in human standards. People have become self-centered. They have forgotten or ignored the wider interests of the country. The essential and noteworthy features of our struggle were: sacrifice,  truth,  and  non-violence.  The  weapons  of  the

World  War  were:  violence,  brute  force,  political  and military moves, and counter moves. As a result of the churning of the ocean, the world has emitted poison.  That  poison  is  spreading  all  over  and there is none to swallow it. The countries which

were free have managed to digest it somewhat, but we, who have just attained our freedom, it is hard to do the same. Therefore, those who think that having attained freedom they have attained everything  have  really  attained  nothing!  The  freedom  that  we have won is yet to be consolidated.  The foundations of freedom have to be well and truly laid! This one-year old child has to be nursed and nourished, instructed and streng thened. It is for us to do it and we must do it.

# PAGE 3

In India today, there is no time for useless controversies and unnecessary  debates  and  disputes.  One  can  indulge  in  these pastimes when one has time and leisure. At present, we have to  occupy  ourselves  with  the  all  absorbing  task  of  making  the foundation of our freedom strong and unassailable. We have to reflect on our place in this broken and destructed world and what our duty and obligations are! If we fail to make the best use of our freedom to make it worthwhile and turn it to our advantage and advancements, future generations will heap curses on us. They will say that a spiritualist, a great soul gave us this precious boon, but we did not know how to retain it and lost it.

I should like to urge upon those who train citizens of tomorrow and to those citizens of tomorrow that we have yet to stand on our feet. We must concentrate on one thing alone, viz., how to make our country  strong  and  united.  We  can  make  it  strong when hearts are pure and when we fully appreciate our duty. Now that foreign rulers have gone, are we in a position to sustain the whole burden that has devolved on us? When we took over from  them,  the  administrative  fabric  was  in  tatters.  We  have to  mend and place it. This, in itself, is a heavy responsibility. It  is  for  our  universities to train young men to shoulder these responsibilities.

The great university of life is full of experiences, but to make full  use  of  those  experiences, all of us students, teachers and professors  -  have to be cautious and on guard.

The most essential requisite is character. If your character is lacking and you leave the precincts of the alma mater without your character fully developed, you will be wasting an opportunity of a lifetime.

You have to realise that India has to attain its rightful place in the comity of nations. The leadership of Asia would be hers if she conducts herself well and if her citizens make their fitting contribution to nation's resurgence. Whatever trials and troubles we  might  have  passed  through,  there  is  no  denying  the  fact that we have a precious inheritance and the teachings we have received from the departed leaders are great assets for us.

India abounds in the resources of nature and manpower. They are awaiting full use. That task must devolve on young men and women. We ourselves were trained in the school of experience. We fought for freedom and we have attained that prize for you. It is now up to you to prove yourself worthy of the same. This you can do only if you work with single-minded devotion to the cause of the country. It is only then that you can deserve this freedom and be proud of it.

Look Up and Understand conferring endeavour obligation precincts unassailable

Look Up and Understand comity of nations communalism inheritance resurgence

The real danger of India lies in our disunity. That poison of communalism was spread in the past. You should draw a curtain over it. Only then could we equip ourselves for the freedom that has come to us. There are still people in the country whose loyalty to India has not settled down. They should and will leave India.

This is the occasion for mutual help and mutual cooperation. We must know what our duty is as true citizens. Your teacher has to impart that duty. Unless we learn to shoulder our responsibility in the true spirit of discipline and citizenship we cannot go ahead. We must strengthen our shoulders and our legs so that we can stand erect and bear the burden that has devolved on us. Then alone would we secure the real objective of freedom.
