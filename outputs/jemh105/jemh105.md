## ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS

## 5.1 Introduction

You must have observed that in nature, many things follow a certain pattern, such as the petals of a sunflower, the holes of a honeycomb, the grains on a maize cob, the spirals on a pineapple and on a pine cone, etc.

We now look for some patterns which occur in our day-to-day life. Some such examples are :

- (i) Reena applied for a job and got selected. She has been offered a job with a starting monthly salary of ` 8000, with an annual increment of ` 500 in her salary. Her salary (in ` ) for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . . years will be, respectively

- (ii) The lengths of the rungs of a ladder decrease uniformly  by  2  cm  from  bottom  to  top (see  Fig.  5.1).  The  bottom  rung  is  45  cm  in length.  The  lengths  (in  cm)  of  the  1st,  2nd, 3rd, . . ., 8th rung from the bottom to the top are, respectively

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- (iii) In a savings scheme, the amount becomes 5 4 times of itself after every 3 years. The maturity amount (in ` ) of an investment of ` 8000 after 3, 6, 9 and 12 years will be, respectively :

10000, 12500, 15625, 19531.25

- (v) Shakila puts ` 100 into her daughter's money box when she was one year old and increased the amount by ` 50 every year. The amounts of money (in ` ) in the box on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, . . . birthday were

100, 150, 200, 250, . . ., respectively.

- (vi) A pair of rabbits are too young to produce in their first month. In the second, and every subsequent month, they produce a new pair. Each new pair of rabbits produce a new pair in their second month and in every subsequent month (see Fig. 5.3). Assuming no rabbit dies, the number of pairs of rabbits at the start of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . ., 6th month, respectively are :

In the examples above, we observe some patterns. In some, we find that the succeeding terms are obtained by adding a fixed number, in other by multiplying with  a  fixed  number,  in  another  we  find  that  they  are  squares  of  consecutive numbers, and so on.

In this chapter, we shall discuss one of these patterns in which succeeding terms are obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding terms. We shall also see how to find their n th terms and the sum of n consecutive terms, and use this knowledge in solving some daily life problems.

## 5.2 Arithmetic Progressions

Consider the following lists of numbers :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Each of the numbers in the list is called a term .

Given a term, can you write the next term in each of the lists above? If so, how will you write it? Perhaps by following a pattern or rule. Let us observe and write the rule.

- In (i), each term is 1 more than the term preceding it.
- In (ii), each term is 30 less than the term preceding it.
- In (iii), each term is obtained by adding 1 to  the term preceding it.
- In  (iv),  all  the  terms  in  the  list  are  3  ,  i.e.,  each  term  is  obtained  by  adding (or subtracting) 0 to the term preceding it.
- In (v), each term is obtained by adding - 0.5 to (i.e., subtracting 0.5 from) the term preceding it.

In all the lists above, we see that successive terms are obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding terms. Such list of numbers is said to form an Arithmetic Progression ( AP ) .

So, an arithmetic progression is a list of numbers in which each term  is obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding term except the first term.

This fixed number is called the common difference of the AP. Remember that it can be positive, negative or zero .

# PAGE 4

Let us denote the first term of an AP by a 1 , second term by a 2 , . . ., n th term by a n and the common difference by d . Then the AP becomes a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , . . ., a n .

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Some more examples of AP are:

- (a) The heights ( in cm ) of some students of a school standing in a queue in the morning assembly are 147 , 148, 149, . . ., 157.
- (b) The minimum temperatures ( in degree celsius ) recorded for a week in the month of January in a city, arranged in ascending order are

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- (c) The balance money ( in ` ) after paying 5 % of the total  loan of ` 1000 every month is 950, 900, 850, 800, . . ., 50.
- (d) The cash prizes ( in ` ) given by a school to the toppers of Classes I to XII are, respectively, 200, 250, 300, 350, . . ., 750.
- (e) The total savings (in ` ) after every month for 10 months when ` 50 are saved each month are 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500.

It is left as an exercise for you to explain why each of the lists above is an AP .

You can see that

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

represents an arithmetic progression where a is  the  first  term  and d the  common difference. This is called the general form of an AP.

Note that in examples (a) to (e) above, there are only a finite number of terms. Such an AP is called a finite AP. Also note that each of these Arithmetic Progressions (APs) has a last term. The APs in examples (i) to (v) in this section, are not finite APs and so they are called infinite Arithmetic Progressions .  Such APs do not have a last term.

Now, to know about an AP, what is the minimum information that you need? Is it enough to know the first term? Or, is it enough to know only the common difference? You will find that you will need to know both - the first term a and the common difference d .

For instance if the first term a is 6 and the common difference d is 3, then the AP is

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

and if a is 6 and d is - 3, then the AP is

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

# PAGE 5

## Similarly, when

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

So, if you know what a and d are, you can list the AP. What about the other way round? That is, if you are given a list of numbers can you say that it is an AP and then find a and d ? Since a is the first term, it can easily be written. We know that in an AP , every succeeding term is obtained by adding d to the preceding term. So, d found by subtracting any term from its succeeding term, i.e., the term which immediately follows it should be same for an AP.

For example, for the list of numbers :

We have

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Here the difference of any two consecutive terms in each case is 3. So, the given list is an AP whose first term a is 6 and common difference d is 3.

For the list of numbers : 6, 3, 0, - 3, . . .,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Similarly this is also an AP whose first term is 6 and the common difference is -3.

In general, for an AP a 1 , a 2 , . . ., a n , we have

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where a k + 1 and a k are the ( k + 1)th and the k th terms respectively.

To obtain d in a given AP, we need not find all of a 2 -a 1 , a 3 -a 2 , a 4 -a 3 , . . . . It is enough to find only one of them.

Consider the list of numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, . . . . By looking at it, you can tell that the difference between any two consecutive terms is not the same. So, this is not an AP.

# PAGE 6

Note that to find d in the AP : 6, 3, 0, - 3, . . ., we have subtracted 6 from 3 and not 3 from 6, i.e., we should subtract the k th term from the ( k + 1) th term even if the ( k + 1) th term is smaller.

Let us make the concept more clear through some examples.

Example 1 : For the AP : 3 2 , 1 2 ,  -1 2 ,  -3 2 ,  .  .  .,  write  the  first  term a and the common difference d .

Solution :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Remember that we can find d using any two consecutive terms, once we know that the numbers are in AP.

Example 2 : Which of the following list of numbers form an AP? If they form an AP, write the next two terms :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

i.e., a k + 1 -a k is the same every time.

So, the given list of numbers forms an AP with the common difference d = 6.

The next two terms are: 22 + 6 = 28 and 28 + 6 = 34.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

i.e., a k + 1 -a k is the same every time.

So, the given list of numbers forms an AP with the common difference d = - 2. The next two terms are:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

As a 2 - a 1  a 3 - a 2 , the given list of numbers does not form an AP.

# PAGE 7

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

So, the given list of numbers does not form an AP.

## EXERCISE 5.1

## 5.3 n th Term of an AP

Let us consider the situation again, given in Section 5.1 in which Reena applied for a job and got selected. She has been offered the job with a starting monthly salary of ` 8000, with an annual increment of ` 500. What would be her monthly salary for the fifth year?

To answer this, let us first see what her monthly salary for the second year would be.

It would be ` (8000 + 500) = ` 8500. In the same way, we can find the monthly salary for the 3rd, 4th and 5th year by adding ` 500 to the salary of the previous year. So, the salary for the 3rd year = ` (8500 + 500)

=

# PAGE 9

Now, looking at the pattern formed above, can you find her monthly salary for the 6th year? The 15th year? And, assuming that she will still be working in the job, what about the monthly salary for the 25th year? You would calculate this by adding ` 500 each time to the salary of the previous year to give the answer. Can we make this process shorter? Let us see. You may have already got some idea from the way we have obtained the salaries above.

Salary for the 15th year

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

In the same way, her monthly salary for the 25th year would be

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

This example would have given you some idea about how to write the 15th term, or the 25th term, and more generally, the n th term of the AP.

Let a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ,  .  .  .  be  an  AP  whose  first  term a 1 is a and  the  common difference is d .

Then,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Looking at the pattern, we can say that the n th term a n = a + ( n - 1) d .

So, the n th term a n of the AP with first term a and common difference d is given by a = a + ( n - 1) d.

n

i.e.,

# PAGE 10

- a n is also called the general term of the AP . If there are m terms in the AP, then a m represents the last  term which is sometimes also denoted by l .

Let us consider some examples.

Example 3 : Find the 10th term of the AP :  2, 7, 12, . . .

Solution : Here, a = 2, d = 7 - 2 = 5 and n

=  10.

We have

$$a n = a + ( n - 1) d$$

So,

$$a 10 = 2 + (10 - 1) × 5 = 2 + 45 = 47$$

Therefore, the 10th term of the given AP is 47.

Example 4 : Which term of the AP : 21, 18, 15, . . . is - 81? Also, is any term 0? Give reason for your answer.

Solution : Here, a = 21, d = 18 - 21 = - 3 and a n = - 81, and we have to find n .

As we have

So,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Therefore, the 35th term of the given AP is - 81.

Next, we want to know if there is any n for which a n = 0. If such an n is there, then

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

i.e., i.e.,

So, the eighth term is 0.

Example 5 :

Determine the AP whose 3rd term is 5 and the 7th term is 9.

Solution :

We have

and

a

3

=

a

+ (3 - 1)

d

=

a

+ 2

d

= 5

(1)

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Solving the pair of linear equations (1) and (2), we get

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Hence, the required AP is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, . . .

# PAGE 11

Example 6 : Check whether 301 is a term of the list of numbers 5, 11, 17, 23, . . . Solution : We have :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

As a k + 1 -a k is the same for k = 1, 2, 3, etc., the given list of numbers is an AP.

Now,

a

= 5

and

d

= 6.

Let 301 be a term, say, the n th term of this AP.

We know that a n = a + ( n - 1) d So, 301 = 5 + ( n - 1) × 6 i.e., 301 = 6 n - 1 So, n = 302 151 6 3 

But n should be a positive integer (Why?). So, 301 is not a term of the given list of numbers.

Example 7 : How many two-digit numbers are divisible by 3?

Solution : The list of two-digit numbers divisible by 3 is :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Is this an AP? Yes it is. Here, a = 12, d = 3, a n = 99.

As we have

i.e., i.e.,

i.e.,

a

n

=

a

+ (

n

- 1)

d

,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

So, there are 30 two-digit numbers divisible by 3.

Example 8 : Find the 11th term from the last term (towards the first term) of the AP : 10, 7, 4, . . ., - 62.

Solution :

where

Here,

a

= 10,

d

= 7 - 10 = - 3,

l

= - 62,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

# PAGE 12

To find the 11th term from the last term, we will find the total number of terms in the AP.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

So, there are 25 terms in the given AP.

The 11th term from the last term will be the 15th term. (Note that it will not be the 14th term. Why?)

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

i.e., the 11th term from the last term is - 32.

## Alternative Solution :

If we write the given AP in the reverse order, then a = - 62 and d = 3 (Why?) So, the question now becomes finding the 11th term with these a and d .

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

So, the 11th term, which is now the required term, is - 32.

Example 9 : A sum of ` 1000 is invested at 8% simple interest per year. Calculate the interest at the end of each year. Do these interests form an AP? If so, find the interest at the end of 30 years making use of this fact.

Solution : We know that the formula to calculate simple interest is given by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

So, the interest at the end of the 1st year = 1000×8×1 100 ` = ` 80

The interest at the end of the 2nd year = 1000×8×2 100 ` = ` 160

The interest at the end of the 3rd year = 1000×8×3 100 ` = ` 240

Similarly, we can obtain the interest at the end of the 4th year, 5th year, and so on.

So, the interest (in ` ) at the end of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . . years, respectively are

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

# PAGE 13

It is an AP as the difference between the consecutive terms in the list is 80, i.e., d = 80. Also, a = 80.

So, to find the interest at the end of 30 years, we shall find a 30 .

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

So, the interest at the end of 30 years will be ` 2400.

Example 10 : In a flower bed, there are 23 rose plants in the first row, 21 in the second, 19 in the third, and so on. There are 5 rose plants in the last row. How many rows are there in the flower bed?

Solution : The number of rose plants in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . ., rows are :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

It forms an AP (Why?). Let the number of rows in the flower bed be n .

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

So, there are 10 rows in the flower bed.

Here, the amount of money (in ` ) put in the money box on her first, second, third, fourth . . . birthday were respectively 100, 150, 200, 250, . . . till her 21st birthday. To find the total amount in the money box on her 21st birthday, we will have to write each of the 21 numbers in the list above and then add them up. Don't you think it would be a tedious and time consuming process? Can we make the process shorter? This would be possible if we can find a method for getting this sum. Let us see.

We  consider  the  problem  given  to  Gauss  (about  whom  you  read  in Chapter 1), to solve when he was just 10 years old. He was asked to find the sum of the positive integers from 1 to 100. He immediately replied that the sum is 5050. Can you guess how did he do? He wrote :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

And then, reversed the numbers to write

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Adding these two, he got

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

So,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

We will now use the same technique to find the sum of the first n terms of an AP :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The n th term of this AP is a + ( n - 1) d . Let S denote the sum of the first n terms of the AP. We have

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Rewriting the terms in reverse order, we have

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

On adding (1) and (2), term-wise. we get

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

or, 2S = n [2 a + ( n - 1) d ] (Since, there are n terms)

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

So, the sum of the first n terms of an AP is given by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Now, if there are only n terms in an AP, then a n = l , the last term. From (3), we see that

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

This form of the result is useful when the first and the last terms of an AP are given and the common difference is not given.

Now we return to the question that was posed to us in the beginning. The amount of money (in Rs) in the money box of Shakila's daughter on 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th birthday, . . ., were 100, 150, 200, 250, . . ., respectively.

This is an AP. We have to find the total money collected on her 21st birthday, i.e., the sum of the first 21 terms of this AP .

# PAGE 17

Here, a = 100, d = 50 and n = 21. Using the formula :

we have

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

So, the amount of money collected on her 21st birthday is ` 12600.

Hasn't the use of the formula made it much easier to solve the problem?

We also use S n in place of S to denote the sum of first n terms of the AP. We write S 20 to denote the sum of the first 20 terms of an AP . The formula for the sum of the first n terms involves four quantities S, a , d and n . If we know any three of them, we can find the fourth.

Remark : The n th term of an AP is the difference of the sum to first n terms and the sum to first ( n - 1) terms of it, i.e., a = S - S .

n n n - 1

Let us consider some examples.

Example 11 : Find the sum of the first 22 terms of the AP : 8, 3, -2, . . .

Solution : Here, a = 8, d = 3 - 8 = -5, n = 22.

We know that

Therefore,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

So, the sum of the first 22 terms of the AP is - 979.

Example 12 : If the sum of the first 14 terms of an AP is 1050 and its first term is 10, find the 20th term.

Solution : Here, S

As

14 = 1050, n = 14, a = 10.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

# PAGE 18

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Example 13 : How many terms of the AP : 24, 21, 18, . . . must be taken so that their sum is 78?

Solution : Here, a = 24, d = 21 - 24 = -3, S n = 78. We need to find n .

We know that

So,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

or

n

= 4

or

13

Both values of n are admissible. So, the number of terms is either 4 or 13.

## Remarks:

1. In this case, the sum of the first 4 terms = the sum of the first 13 terms = 78.
2. Two answers are possible because the sum of the terms from 5th to 13th will be zero. This is because a is positive and d is negative, so that some terms will be positive and some others negative, and will cancel out each other.
3. (i) the first 1000 positive integers (ii) the first n positive integers

## Example 14 : Find the sum of :

## Solution :

- (i) Let S = 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + 1000

Using the formula  S n = ( ) 2  n a l for the sum of the first n terms of an AP, we have

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

So, the sum of the first 1000 positive integers is 500500.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Here a = 1 and the last term l is n .

# PAGE 19

Therefore,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

So, the sum of first n positive integers is given by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Example 15 : Find the sum of first 24 terms of the list of numbers whose n th term is given by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Solution :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

List of numbers becomes 5, 7, 9, 11, . . .

Here,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

So, it forms an AP with common difference d = 2.

To find S 24 , we have n = 24, a = 5, d = 2.

Therefore,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

So, sum of first 24 terms of the list of numbers is 672.

Example 16 : A manufacturer of TV sets produced 600 sets in the third year and 700 sets in the seventh year. Assuming that the production increases uniformly by a fixed number every year, find :

- (i) the production in the 1st year
- (iii) the total production in first 7 years

Solution : (i) Since the production increases uniformly by a fixed number every year, the number of TV sets manufactured in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . ., years will form an AP .

Let us denote the number of TV sets manufactured in the n th year by a n .

Then,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- (ii) the production in the 10th year

# PAGE 20

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Solving these equations, we get d = 25 and a = 550.

Therefore, production of TV sets in the first year is 550.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

So, production of TV sets in the 10th year is 775.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Thus, the total production of TV sets in first 7 years is 4375.

## 5.5 Summary

In this chapter, you have studied the following points :

1. An arithmetic progression (AP) is a list of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding a fixed number d to the preceding term, except the first term. The fixed number d is called the common difference .

The general form of an AP is a , a + d , a + 2 d , a + 3 d , . . .

2. A given list of numbers a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ,  .  .  .  is  an AP,  if  the  differences a 2 -a 1 , a 3 -a 2 , a 4 -a 3 , . . ., give the same value, i.e., if a k + 1 -a k is the same for different values of k .
3. In an AP with first term a and common difference d , the n th term (or the general term) is given by a n = a + ( n - 1) d.
4. The sum of the first n terms of an AP is given by :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

5. If l is the last term of the finite AP, say the n th term, then the sum of all terms of the AP is given by :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## A NOTE TO THE READER

If a,  b , c are  in AP,  then b = 2 a c  and b is  called  the  arithmetic mean of a and c .
