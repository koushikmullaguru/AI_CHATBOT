## Foreword Foreword Foreword Foreword

The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that children's life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).

The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.

These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual  calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children's life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address  the  problem  of  curricular  burden  by  restructuring  and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child  psychology  and  the  time  available  for  teaching.  The  textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory  committee  for  textbooks  in  Social  Sciences,  at  the  higher secondary level, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor M.H. Qureshi for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to

the institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development under  the  Chairpersonship  of  Professor  Mrinal  Miri  and  Professor  G.P. Deshpande, for their  valuable  time  and  contribution.  As  an  organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision and refinement.

## Rationalisation  of  Content  in  the  Textbook Rationalisation  of  Content  in  the  Textbook Rationalisation  of  Content  in  the  Textbook Rationalisation  of  Content  in  the  Textbook

In  view  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  it  is  imperative  to  reduce content  load  on  students.  The  National  Education  Policy  2020, also  emphasises  reducing  the  content  load  and  providing opportunities  for  experiential  learning  with  creative  mindset.  In this  background,  the  NCERT  has  undertaken  the  exercise  to rationalise  the  textbooks  across  all  classes.  Learning  Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into  consideration  in  this  exercise.

## Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:

- Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same class
- Similar  content  included  in  the  lower  or  higher  class  in the  same  subject
- Difficulty  level
- Content,  which  is  easily  accessible  to  students  without much interventions from teachers and can be learned by children  through  self-learning  or  peer-learning
- Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given above.
