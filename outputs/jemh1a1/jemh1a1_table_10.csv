"Let XYbethe given line, P a point not lyingonXY and PM, PA 1 , PA 2 , . . . etc., be the line segments drawn from P to the points of the line XY, out of which PM is the smallest (see Fig. A1.5).","Since we have to prove that out of all PM, PA 1 , PA 2 , . . . etc., the smallest is perpendi- cular to XY, we start by taking these line segments."
Let PM be not perpendicular to XY,This is the negation of the statement to be proved by contradiction.
"Draw a perpendicular PN on the line XY, shown by dotted lines in Fig. A1.5.",We often need constructions to prove our results.
"PN is the smallest of all the line segments PM, PA 1 , PA 2 , . . . etc., which means PN < PM.",Side of right triangle is less than the hypotenuse and known property of numbers.
This contradicts our hypothesis that PM is the smallest of all such line segments.,Precisely what we want!
"Therefore, the line segment PM is perpendicular to XY.",We reach the conclusion.
