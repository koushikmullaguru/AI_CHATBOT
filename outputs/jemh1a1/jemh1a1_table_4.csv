1.,Let p be a prime number greater than 3.,"Since the result has to do with a prime number greater than 3, westart with such a number."
2.,"Dividing p by 6, we find that p can be of the form 6 k , 6 k + 1, 6 k + 2, 6 k + 3, 6 k + 4, or 6 k + 5, where k is an integer.",Using Euclid's division lemma.
3.,"But 6 k = 2(3 k ), 6 k + 2 = 2(3 k + 1), 6 k + 4 = 2(3 k + 2), and 6 k + 3 = 3(2 k + 1). So, they are not primes.",We now analyse the remainders given that p is prime.
4.,"So, p is forced to be of the form 6 k + 1 or 6 k + 5, for some integer k .",Wearrive at this conclusion having eliminated the other options.
