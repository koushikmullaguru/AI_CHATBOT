Physical education (PE) aims at the optimum development of an individual through continuous process of learning and participation in guided physical activities. In other words, it aims at optimum physical, mental and social development of an individual.

## What is Physical Education?

According to Webster's Dictionary, 'Physical education is a part of education which gives instructions in the development and care of the body rending from simple callisthenic exercises to a course of study providing training in hygiene, gymnastics, and  the  performance  and  management  of  athletics  and games.' Central Advisory Board of Physical Education and Recreation  defines  PE  as  'an  education  through  physical activities  for  the  development  of  total  personality  of  the child to its fullness and perfection in body, mind and spirit. Physical education is an area through which sports, outdoor activities like trekking, hiking, camping, gymnastics, dance, aquatics  are  used  to  train  individuals  in  motor  skills  and fitness skills. Physical education also assists the schools in carrying out responsibility of developing personal and social skills  in  students.'  In  fact,  PE  is  an  integral  part  of  total education.  It  makes  significant  contribution  towards  the achievement of desirable educational and health outcomes. It also enables children to acquire necessary knowledge and skills  to  stimulate  them  to  actively  participate  in  physical activities throughout their lifespan.

## Activity 1.1

- Measure your pulse and  respiration rates before and after playing different games or participation in a sport event.

## Healthy lifestyle

By engaging in various physical and yogic activities, one can ensure a healthy lifestyle.

## Academic achievement

By  participating  in  various  physical  and  yogic  activities, students get stimulated to face challenges and are encouraged  to  think  productively.  This  tends  to  improve their concentration of academic achievement.

## Develops skills and experiences

Various  activities  learned  during  school  days  such  as gymnastics, running, jumping, throwing, swimming, playing  team games, learning the rules and regulations of the  games  and  being  disciplined  help  students  to  develop sportspersonship.

## Positive self-image

Participation in regular physical activities also helps students to  understand  the  need  for  appreciation  of  own  positive aspects and develop ability to compete and cooperate with others. Self belief is also reinforced.

## Improves interpersonal relationships

- Collect information from  10  persons  and prepare a project on physical  activities  and eating habits and their impact  on  the  human body.

When you play with other students and teams, you learn to develop interpersonal relationships with members of your own team as well as with members of other teams. It builds interactive and positive social environment.

## Develops internal organ systems

By  participating  in  physical  and  yogic  activities,  students respond to the increased demands  of  daily life in a healthy  way.  The  system  of  the  body  responds  to  stimuli and becomes more efficient at coping with the load exerted on it.

## objEctivEs of Physical Education

Broadly,  there  are  four  objectives  of  Physical  Education which are as follows.

## Physical fitness

It refers to the state where an individual is physically fit and has developed great endurance, speed and strength. Physical fitness is essential for leading a happy, healthy, vigorous and fulfilling  life.  Physical  and motor fitness helps to learn and develop technical and tactical knowledge of sports and games.

## Social efficiency

It is concerned with one's adaptation to group living. Physical education activities  provide  ample  opportunities  to  develop  such traits and life skills as cooperation, respect for others, loyalty, sportspersonship, self-confidence, etc. All these qualities help a person to become more social and a responsible citizen.

## Sports culture

It aims at developing an understanding and appreciation of one's own local environment as well as the global environment. By  participating  in  various  physical  activities,  such  as, dance, sports, games and yoga, a person fully understands the history, culture, traditions, etc., and also the aesthetic values associated with these activities.

## Mental efficiency

In physical education, a child has to participate in a number of  physical  and  yogic  activities.  These  activities  not  only require involvement of the body but also require use of the intellect  to  carry  out  the  task.  Positive,  healthy  and  active body-mind relationship helps to enhance mental efficiency.

## scoPE of Physical Education

Physical education has evolved as a multi-disciplinary subject and its scope is not just confined to physical fitness and the rules  of  games  and  sports.  The  meaning  and  definition  of Physical Education, its aims and objectives and scope, and factors  affecting  physical  fitness  and  wellness,  rules  and other necessary knowledge about health, games and sports and  yoga  are  major  areas  of  study  in  physical  education. Games and sports, as well as, cultural heritage, development of leadership qualities and group dynamics through sports and games are also an integral part of this discipline.

In  fact,  physical  education  now  includes  several  areas which  belong  to  other  subjects  like Biology,  Genetics, Psychology, Physics, Bio Chemistry, Sociology, Anthropology, History, Culture, Medicine, Media studies, etc.

Contents from other disciplines like laws of motion, types of  lever,  force,  equilibrium  and  centre  of  gravity,  common postural deviations, therapeutic modalities in rehabilitation, sports massage, prevention and first aid for common sportinjuries, are also the content of physical education. Biological foundations such as heredity and environment, growth and development are also included in it.

Content  drawn  from  psychology,  such  as,  importance of  psychology  in  education  with  special  reference  to  physical education,  such  as,  individual  differences  and  personality, learning  and  motivation  are  related  to  Physical  Education.

Personality  means,  nature  and  factors  affecting  performance and transfer of training constitute one of its major components. Similarly, contents related to basic physiology, anatomy, growth  and  development  during  adolescence  also  form  part of the content of physical education. Some other contents are organ system, functions of bones, definitions and classification of  joints,  movement  around  a  joint,  general  characteristics (properties) of muscles, effects of exercise on muscular system, circulatory  system,  respiratory  system  and  digestive  system, health dimensions, environment, importance of health, health problems, hygiene, community health, aspects of school health services,  food,  nutrition  and  balanced  diet,  communicable and non-communicable diseases, coronavirus, HIV, AIDS and drug abuse.

## 1. What is Coronavirus?

Covid 19 is the infectious disease caused by the recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. That is why it is called the Novel (new) Coronavirus (NCoV).

## 2. What are the symptoms?

The most common symptoms of Coronavirus are fever, cough and difficulty in breathing. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don't develop any symptoms and dont't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. People with fever cough and difficulty in breathing should seek medical attention immediately.

## 3. How does Coronavirus spread?

People  can  catch  Coronavirus  from  others  who  have  the  virus.  The  disease  can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with Coronavirus coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch Coronavirus by first touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch Coronavirus if they breathe in from a person with Coronavirus who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter away from a person who is sick.

## 4. How to prevent Coronavirus?

Contents related to Yoga also form a part of this area. Common  Yogic  Practices  are Yama and  Niyama, Asana , Pranayama , Pratyahara , Bandha Mudra , Shatkarma/Kriya , Meditation.  It  includes Ahara (Food), Vihara (Relaxation), Achara (Conduct), Vichara (Thinking), Vyavahara (Behaviour).

Theories of training are also included in this subject area. These are principles  and characteristics of sports training, methods  of  sports  training,  training  load,  warming  up, cooling down, aerobic and anaerobic activities, calisthenics and rhythmic exercises, specific training program for development of various motor qualities, techniques, tactics and talent identification. It is also important to understand the difference between play, games and sports.

## Play, GamEs and sPort

Though  these  terms  are  used  interchangeably,  these  are actually different.

## Play

Play is spontaneous. It is usually a creative activity but has its own limitation and space. One plays voluntarily for fun and pleasure. Play, however, is a broad area which includes both games and sports. The distinctive features of play are that they are free, separate, uncertain, governed by self rules and creative.

## Games

Generally  the  word  games  and  sports  are  used  together. A game is an activity involving more players, defined by a goal that the players tries to reach, and some set rules to play. By  masses,  games  are  played  primarily  for  entertainment or enjoyment. The difference of purpose differentiates sport from game, combined with the notion of individual or team skill. Games are also played on the basis of a set of rules. A game is defined as a goal that the players try to achieve. A person who participates in a game is known as a player.

## Sport

A sport is a physical activity carried out under an agreed set of rules, for competition or self-enjoyment or a combination of  these.    Sport  are  the  kind  of  activities  in  which  similar kind  of  body  movement  is  repeated  over  a  long  time.  For example, swimming and running and almost all the track and field events come under sport. Sport involves an activity or activities where the mental capabilities of the sportsperson are judged. In a sport, it is the sportsperson or the individual who  determines  the  outcome.  A  person  participating  in  a sport is called an athlete or a sportsperson.

## rElationshiP of hEalth and Physical Education With othEr disciPlinEs of KnoWlEdGE

Health and Physical Education (HPE) classes provide space for exploring new ideas related to personal and community health. These ideas might then be used by students in various other  fields  of  learning,  such  as,  arts,  science,  civics  and citizenship, communication, design, creativity and technology and languages (english, hindi and other regional languages), humanities (e.g. history, geography, economics, etc.), information and communication technology and psychology.

## Art

Health  and  physical  education  teachers  can  incorporate activities  related  to  performing  arts,  drawing,  painting, dance, drama, media, music and visual communication into their  programs.  These  involve  both  fine  motor  skills  and whole  body  movement  including  rhythmic  movement.  As body movements are part of both arts practice and health and  physical  education,  these  promote  health  knowledge, understanding of the body and lead to physical fitness and enhancing of creative skills at the same time.

## Science

The human body is a common concern of both science and health and physical education. In science, students study the human body from the cellular level to the systems level, with a focus on anatomy and physiology. In health and physical education learning is focused on the requirements for good health and the promotion of a healthy body. Students gain an understanding of the role of physical and yogic activities in ensuring good health and can link the functioning of the musculo-skeletal, digestive, endocrine and nervous systems studied in science, for the promotion of the physical, social, mental and emotional health of individuals within a society. Students consider it their personal responsibilities to discuss and adopt health issues, both in relation to their own safety and  well-being,  as  well  as  to  the  safety  and  well-being  of others.  It  also  contributes  in  the  designing  of  training  for movements of organs to achieve optimal performance in the area of play, sports and games.

## Social science

Social sciences promote  the  idea  that  citizens require knowledge and understanding of civic institutions and the skills  and  willingness to actively participate in functioning of the society. Similarly, in health and physical education,

![Image](outputs/jehp101/jehp101_artifacts/image_000012_788b4806d28944ad68501a13a392a55a67e15b35dfe04d0c607b085936469d74.png)

# PAGE 7

students are encouraged to become active and responsible members  of  their  community.  Key  concepts  within  health and  physical  education  classes  include  understanding  of the  importance  of  personal  identity  within  a  community, what makes a community and how to engage with different members and agencies within a community. Participation in physical activity and sports also reflect values, rules, rights and responsibilities indicative of a democratic society.

## Communication

Communication  involves  developing  knowledge,  skills  and behaviors that empower students to respond to, make meaning of, and deconstruct a range of communication forms. Effective communication is a key skill in health and physical education. It is essential that students develop the ability to listen, view and respond with respect to the content and context in which communication happens. Learning in the health and physical education domain involves developing familiarity with forms, language and conventions used in different forms of public, personal and interpersonal communication.

## Design, Creativity and Technology

Design, Creativity and Technology (DCT) help in developing sport  goods,  sportwear,  sport  software  programme,  etc. These  are  associated  with  knowledge  and  promotion.    In this area students  learn about  the characteristic  and properties of how all these aspects differ from each other. These investigations assist students to make decisions about appropriate solution. Students analyse and evaluate factors, such as, social, cultural and economic factors that influence design, creativity and technology.

## Language(s)

Languages help students to develop critical approaches to the ideas and thoughts collated to read, view, write, compare, research and talk about texts. Health and Physical Education teachers can use examples related to health and wellbeing to  encourage  students  to  reflect  on  their  lifestyles  and analyse ways by which the media influences their attitude towards health. For example, Health and Physical Education emphasises on the importance of physical fitness, self-esteem and body image in the maintenance of good health.

## Economics

Economics  is  the  study  of  how  society  allocates  scarce resources to satisfy the wants and needs of its members. Within the health and physical education (HPE) context, consumer health assists students to become more informed  consumers  of  health  products  and  services.

- Investigate the cost of specific behaviours, illness or disease in the community, such as, the economic impact of obesity and inactivity on society.
- Explore the influence of government spending on health outcomes for individuals and the community.
- Identify various locations from the map and interpret maps for outdoor adventure activities.
- Investigate the impact of development and globalisation on poverty, the links between food, hunger and technology, identifying and locating facilities and services that contribute to the health and safety of communities on a local and national level.

# PAGE 8

## Activity 1.5

- Create a report and may be a presentation about a game of your choice.
- Capture still and moving images of sporting activities organised in your school and edit or annotate them to explain skill development or tactics.
- Identify, collect and evaluate data from online sources such as, blogs, websites and forums to inform about myths related to Physical Education.

The  cost  of  disease  emerging  from  unhealthy  lifestyle  is also studied to determine the burden of disease on families and community.

## Geography

Students develop skills in reading and interpreting maps of different  kinds  and  at  different  scales.  The  same  knowledge  and skills are reinforced in physical education during orientation on  outdoor  education  activities  (Trekking,  Mountaineering, etc). The investigation of local and global health issues involves collecting information from maps, satellite images, statistical data and information and communication technology based resources.  These  help  students  to  understand  themselves and their world, to apply their understanding in their present lives as well as make evidence based decisions that lead to the kind of future they desire.

## History

The study of History reflects multiple influences and connections  to  an  array  of  other  countries,  cultures  and times.  The  concepts  of  time,  chronology  and  changes  are common to both History and Health and Physical Education. While History focuses on identity from a cultural or national perspective, Health and Physical Education focuses on the range of factors that shape personal identity.

Like skill correction analysis programme, use of cameras and videos in game, use of wind gauge, Iso kinetic machines, construction and marking of pl ay fi eld.

## Information and Communications Technology (ICT)

ICT  can  be  used  to  access,  process,  manage  and  present information and events. It constructs new understanding and communicate with others. It is an integral part of different training measurement and evaluation and offcourse coaching and officiating very helpful in conducting tournament.

## Mathematics

In  Health  and  Physical  Education,  Mathematics  provides tools and procedures which can be used to model situations and  solve  problems  in  areas,  such  as,  scoring  different sporting events involving time, distance, weight and number as variables, calculating percentage improvement in results from data collected through fitness testing or performance in physical activities.

## Language other than English (LOTE)

There are a number of martial arts developed by different societies. The text of these martial arts is discussed in the local languages. For folk dances the accompanying songs are in regional languages and music has its own characteristic tone and rhythm.

The concepts of movement, dance, physical activity and sport, vary  culturally.  These  are  associated  with  their  own  specific languages, vocabularies and discourses. Different societies have different attitudes, values and beliefs about physical activities which are expressed in their regional languages.

## myths and misconcEPtions about Physical Education

Myths are surrounded in regard to relationship of physical education with academic success. One of the most discussed myths in the society is that participation in sport and games reduces academic performance of individual.

## Myths

Participation in sport kills the time of study. Contrary to the widely held assumption that sport and other activities cut upon the time for serious school study, research evidence has shown that students tend to do better in school when they participate in physical activities. There is a positive correlation between performance in sport and the level of academic achievement. Physical education including sport is an integral part of the social  and  cultural  infrastructure  of  a  nation.  It  really  can make a difference in the broader educational process and in changing and enhancing the quality of life. Vigorous physical exercise stimulates circulation, helps prevent skin eruptions and  increases  fluid  intake.  These  exercises  also  promote self-worth and mental health, and support an individual for healing an injury. Sport also enhances physical performance and induce positive physiological adaptation. When children exercise,  their  fitness  needs  are  met,  and  build  up  energy to  learn  and  achieve.  Given the growing number of children with  obesity,  watching  TV,  continuously  being  involved  in computer  games  and  other  unwanted  activities,  frequency of  the  children  getting  involved  in  physical  achievement and academic performance, has taken a back seat. Physical exercise enhances the function in joints, increases the sense of physical well being and promotes a sense of feeling good. It also increases physical working capacity by increasing cardiorespiratory  fitness  and  increased  strength  and  endurance and decreases risk of serious disease that could lead to early disability and death.
