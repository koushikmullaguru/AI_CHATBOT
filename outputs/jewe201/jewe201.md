## Reading CompRehension text i

Given below is a story of the tailor who has been known for his skills in cheating and stealing. Read in groups of four or in pairs. You may discuss the events  and  incidences  of  the  story  with your friends and write them in a sequential manner.

## The Trader and the Tailor

There was a tailor who was known for beating others in the art of being light-fingered and thievery. A trader swore that even with a hundred attempts, the tailor would not be able to take a coil of thread from him without his knowledge.

The trader was told that many others, more intelligent than him,  had  been  beaten  by  the  tailor.  They  said  he  should  not imagine himself so great, for his ego would only give him worse troubles in competition with the tailor. Still, the trader became more competitive and made a wager that the tailor would not be able to rob him of anything.

He wagered an Arab horse with those who taunted him. If the  tailor  failed  to  steal,  then  they  would  have  to  give  him  a horse instead. That night, the trader lay awake troubled by the situation and could not sleep a wink.

In the morning, he put a piece of satin cloth under his arm and went to the bazaar and entered the shop and saluted the cunning rogue warmly. The tailor sprang up from his seat and welcomed the trader, inquiring about his health with cordiality exceeding  even  that  of  the  trader,  planting  in  his  heart  great feelings of affection for him. When the trader heard these songs of  sweetness  from  the  tailor,  he  flung  down  the  piece  of  silk saying, 'Cut this into a coat for me and make it wide below my navel so as not to hamper my legs and tight about it to show off my figure.'

The tailor answered, 'O! kindly man, I will do you a hundred services,' and accepted the order. He measured the satin and inspected  the working surface and all the time chatted away to the trader in idle gossip, about other amirs and of bounties and gifts he had received from them, and about misers and their mean ways, and made the trader laugh with hysterics. During this  beguiling  talk,  he  was  snipping  away  with  his  scissors rapidly, cutting as fast as his lips moved.

The trader was laughing, the tailor was cutting, the trader closed his eyes in joy, the tailor cut extra pieces, tucking them under his thighs, hidden away from all but God. From his delight at  the  tailor's  tales,  the  trader's  former  boast  went  out  of  his mind.  What  satin?  What  boast?  What  wager?  The  trader  was drunk on the jokes told by the tailor.

Then the tailor told such an incredible story that the trader fell over on his back with laughter. The tailor swiftly stitched a swatch of the satin to the hem of his underpants while the trader was paying no attention at all, greedily sucking with every guffaw at the jests the tailor told. The tailor continued to tell funnier and funnier tales and jokes until the trader was completely within his power.

With his eyes shut and his reason vanished, the bewildered and boastful trader was drunk with joy. And the tailor continued to cut, filching yet more of the beautiful cloth, with nothing to stop him now. And yet the trader begged for more.

You who becomes the slave of the jest, no story is more laughable than you yourself, think on this at the edge of your grave. How long will you listen to the lies of this world that leave your mind and spirit unhinged? The Universal Tailor will cut and stitch the hems of a hundred travellers, silly as children.

Eventually the tailor became bored with the whole story and told the trader that he better leave before another tale was told, 'For if I tell another one, the coat will be too tight for you, and you will stop laughing and weep tears of blood.'

1.   Here is an interesting story. The story has been told in two ways. Story A has all the odd sentences (1,3,5,...) and story B has the even sentences (2,4,6,...). Working in pairs, one of you take up Story A and the other take up Story B. The person with Story A will read out the first sentence and the partner (person with story B) will write in the space provided. Then the person with Story B will read sentence two and the partner will write in the space for sentence two. Likewise complete the whole story. Once the story is completed, both of you will read out to each other to check whether you have listened carefully to your partner and written the complete story.

1.  Lencho,  the  main  character  in  the  story,  is  a  farmer. He  supports  his  family  through  farming.  The  conflict  in the  story  happens  when  a  hailstorm  strikes  the  field  and destroys his farm. All the hard work, for nothing! The entire land is wrecked by catastrophe. There is no one who can help. Lencho's complete faith in God is amazing during the calamity.

So,  one  type  of  conflict  dominating  in  the  story  is  man versus  nature.  Discuss  with  your  partner  the  natural  calamities that play havoc in the lives of people. Collect photographs and make a visual presentation to share in the class.

2.  Try writing a small poem on the topic man versus nature. Read aloud the poem with the required stress and intonation. Given below is a poem written by Norman Littleford, which may help you think and compose.

## Writing

1.  The tailor here is a cheat, but Lencho in the story, 'A Letter to God', is naive and simple. He has immense faith in God. How do you distinguish between Lencho and the tailor? What makes them different? Working in pairs, list the actions and qualities of Lencho and the tailor and draw their character sketches.

## Man vs Nature

The heavens roared with thunder as lightning filled the skies was this God getting angry or Nature's big surprise. Is Mother Nature telling us the best way that she can to stop the interference and abuse she gets from man. We marvel at her beauty each time we look around then dig up all her treasures from their natural burial ground. We forget that Nature gives us all that keeps us living we take it all and still want more but never think of giving. We build across the countryside progressing every day but Mother Nature can't progress for man is in the way.

Action: What does the person do?

What quality it reveals?

Lencho lost all his crops.

He  is helpless.  Prays  to God.

Now, write a description of any one of the above based on the details given. You may follow the process approach to writing. First, you read the given information in the box and make a list of describable (adjectives) points used for each person, in your own words. Secondly, take the help of these points to develop an outline in sentence form. Thirdly, use the outline and prepare the first draft of the description of the person and then edit the draft. Prepare the final copy after making all changes. The table

1.  You may have come across some people in your neighbourhood  who  might  have  inspired  you  with  their actions. Talk to them about-
- their  childhood,  their  education,  job,  their  likes  and dislikes
- their  contribution  to  the  enrichment  of  their  village  or town, job, country, etc.
- their interesting features and characteristics

Request for their pictures. Based on the collected information, write  their  portraits  and  present  it  to  the  class.  You  may read on 'How to do project work?' given below.

## How to do project work in the English language classroom?

In addition to the textbook activities, project work could be used as an effective strategy to promote collaborative ways of language learning where we work together in groups to do an activity. We collect information, ideas; observe the language being  used;  use  language  in  real  life  situations;  exchange views and debate on ideas; write the ideas into a report; edit our writing and produce the report in a suitable form. This helps in constructing ideas and analysing critical judgments of the peers to arrive at a decision or conclusion.

It would be of much benefit to learners, if projects planned are of an interdisciplinary nature.

## Designing and managing projects

There are many ways students can be initiated to carry out projects.

- Read  books,  newspapers,  listen  to  the  radio,  watch TV, consult websites and encyclopedia, talk to people, observe events and  proceedings, interview people, record audio/ video, collect pictures and illustrations, interpret them, and report.
- Write  field  notes  to  remember  and  organise  the  data collected.

- Bring  your  own  ideas  to  the  class  and  have  a  class discussion.
- Use language meaningfully and precisely. If the meaning of learning is 'meaning making', the purpose is achieved fully while doing projects.
- Learners should do the projects in group independently. They should not ask their parents to do these or buy readymade products available in the market.
- They may seek information or some help from parents or elders.

## Planning, writing the draft and editing

Having collected  the  required  data,  information  and  ideas, plan and organise the data and interpret them to write the draft. It could be posters, a script of a play (enact and direct a  play),  songs,  essays,  etc.  Editing  is  an  important  part of  writing  the  report.  Students  should  be  made  aware  of process approach involved in writing a good piece of work. Then present it to the whole class or to the school during the assembly or on special occasions (in case of play, songs, etc.).
