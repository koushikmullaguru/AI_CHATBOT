## Let's Begin

1.   Facial expressions are non-verbal communications. These expressions  play  an  important  role  in  a  play.  They  are powerful communication tools. The human face is extremely expressive. It is able to convey countless emotions without saying a word. Expressions tell us the mood of the characters in the play. Some facial expressions are given below. The facial  expressions  are  for  happiness,  sadness,  anger, surprise, fear, and disgust. Look at the facial expressions and write which emotion do they express.

2.   You have read 'The Proposal', a one act play. It is a farce. The play is set in only one location, the drawing room of Chubukov's  house.  All  three  characters  in  the  play  are quarrelsome  people  and  they  quarrel  over  petty  issues. Lomov and Natalya start with the issue like a piece of land that is situated at the border between the two neighbors' properties.  The  discussion  turns  into  a  quarrel  and  the marriage proposal is forgotten. They shout at each other. They are again dragged into an argument over the superiority of each other's dogs. So, they drag their ancestors in their foolish  quarrel.  They  again  abuse  each  other  and  call names.

Now,  make  groups  of  four  and  discuss  the  following points. While conducting the discussion, try to use the facial expressions given above.

- The  marriage  proposal  is  a  mockery  of  romance  and marriage in the upper class.
- The pride in property, even the superiority of dogs, take priority over love and marriage.
- The characters lack patience, stop listening to each other, and then contradict each other.
- Do you think these quarrels will promise a happy life?
- What  qualities  would  you  consider  for  a  well-matched couple?
- Do you think all of us should know how to manage our anger?

## How Can We Control Anger?

Do you get angry when your mother switches off the television? Do you get upset when you lose a game? Do you crib when your teacher does not pay attention to you? Most of us can have 'yes' as an answer to one or more of these situations. Anger sometimes gets the better of us and leaves us to regret the consequences later. The question is 'How can we control anger?'

Anger is a normal and healthy emotion only if we know how to respond to it. Uncontrolled anger can often harm us directly or

indirectly whether we realise or not.  Before we learn to address the issue, let us revisit the concept of anger. Anger is nothing but absence of peace with oneself, people or situations around us. We express it either by being assertive or aggressive.

Let us all become the managers of our own anger. When angry, take	a	few	moments	to	calm	down	(take	five	deep	breaths,	count up to ten, drink water, change your place) before responding. More often than not we do not have control over the situations that distress us. Getting physically active reduces stress. Funny dances,  clapping,  thumping  your  feet,  a  walk,  making  funny faces at the mirror, etc., go a long way in helping us let go of the anger or the frustration  inside  us.  Once  we  have  our  feelings under control, go through all the aspects of the situation and try to see the same situation from different perspectives. If it is a problem try to equip yourself with a few solutions before entering the same situation. Avoid holding a grudge with people and learn when to seek help from others. Realising your own shortcomings can become one of the greatest strengths of character over the years to come.

We can never control circumstances, people or situations as they are constantly changing. The only thing we can control is our response. So we have to increase our capacity to tolerate, ability to understand, and learn to nurture love for others.

## On Violence

There is a great deal of violence in the world. There is physical violence  and  also  inward  violence.  Physical  violence  is  to  kill another, to hurt other people consciously, deliberately or without thought, to say cruel things, full of antagonism and hate and inwardly, inside the skin, to dislike  people,  to  hate  people,  to criticise people. Inwardly, we are always quarrelling, battling, not only with others, but with ourselves. We want people to change, we want to force them to our way of thinking.

In the world, as we grow up, we see a great deal of violence, at all levels of human existence. The ultimate violence is war  -  the killing for ideas, for so-called religious principles, for nationalities, the killing to preserve a little piece of land. To do that, man will kill, destroy, maim, and also be killed himself. There is enormous violence in the world, the rich wanting to keep people poor, and the poor wanting to get rich and in the process hating the rich. And you, being caught in society, are also going to contribute to this.

There is violence between husband, wife, and children. There is violence, antagonism, hate, cruelty, ugly criticism, anger  -  all this  is  inherent  in  man,  inherent  in  each  human  being.  It  is

inherent in you. And education is supposed to help you to go beyond all that, not merely to pass an examination and get a job. You have to be educated so that you become a really beautiful, healthy, sane, rational human being, not a brutal man with a very clever brain who can argue and defend his brutality. You are going to face all this violence as you grow up. You will forget all that you have heard here, and will be caught in the stream of society. You will become like the rest of the cruel, hard, bitter, angry, violent world, and you will not help to bring about a new society, a new world.

But a new world is necessary. A new culture is necessary. The old culture is dead, buried, burnt, exploded, and vaporised. You  have  to  create  a  new  culture.  A  new  culture  cannot  be based on violence. The new culture depends on you because the older generation has built a society based on violence, based on aggressiveness and it is this that has caused all the confusion, all the misery. The older generations have produced this world and you have to change it. You cannot just sit back and say, 'I will follow the rest of the people and seek success and position.' If  you  do,  your  children  are  going  to  suffer.  You  may  have  a good  time,  but  your  children  are  going  to  pay  for  it.  So,  you have to take all that into account, the outward cruelty of man to man in the name of god, in the name of religion, in the name of self-importance, in the name of the security of the family. You will have to consider the outward cruelty and violence, and the inward violence which you do not yet know.

- Though  'tell'  and  'say'  almost  mean  the  same,  there  are differences  in  the  usage  of  the  two  words.  'Tell'  is  always followed by an indirect object but 'say' is not.

## Example

I told my sister that she was right. Ashish said he worked hard to achieve success.

- We can use 'ask' with or without an indirect object.

## Example

My mother asked (me) if I was ready for the party. Madhu asked (the tailor) whether her dresses were ready.

story or someone may read it aloud to you. Then answer the questions that follow.

## Vanka

(Vanka Zhukov, a nine-year old boy, was made an assistant to Alyakhin, the Shoemaker. He didn't go to bed on Christmas Eve. When everyone in the shop had gone to Church, he began to  write  on  a  crumpled sheet of paper. 'Dear Grandfather Konstantin, he wrote', I'm writing a letter to you. I wish you a Merry Christmas and all good things from the Lord God. I've no father and mother, and you are all I have left.')

Vanka  raised  his  eyes  to  the  dark  windowpane.  In  his imagination  he  saw  his  grandfather  Konstantin  standing there. His grandfather was a night watchman on the estate of a rich man. Konstantin was a small, thin and lively old man of	sixty-five	whose	face	was	always	crinkling	with	laughter. In  the  daytime  the  old  man  slept  in  the  servant's  kitchen or cracked jokes with the cooks. At night, wrapped in a big sheepskin coat he made rounds of the estate, blowing his whistle at regular intervals. He was always followed by his dogs, Brownie and Eel. Eel was a particularly remarkable dog. He was extremely respectful and endearing and looked lovingly on friends and strangers alike; yet no one trusted him. He would creep behind someone and bite his leg or run off  with a peasant's chicken. Many a time Eel was beaten mercilessly, yet he always managed to survive.

At  this  very  moment,  Vanka  thought,  grandfather  was probably standing by the gates, looking up at the bright red windows of the village church and cracking jokes with the servants.

'What about a pinch of snuff?' he would say, holding out his snuffbox to the women.

The women would take a pinch and sneeze and the old man would feel happy about it. 'Fine for frozen noses, eh!' he'd say.

The dogs, too,  were  given  snuff.  Brownie  would  sneeze, shake her head and walk away looking hurt. Eel, too polite to sneeze, only wagged his tail.

Vanka  looked  through  the  window.  The  weather  was glorious. The air was fresh. The night was very dark, but the roofs of the houses and trees were all covered with snow.

Vanka sighed, and went on writing: 'Yesterday I was given a beating. That was because when I was rocking the baby in  the  cradle,  I  unfortunately  fell  asleep.  Another  day  the mistress	of	the	house	asked	me	to	clean	the	fish.	I	didn't know	how,	so	she	rubbed	the	fish	all	over	my	face.	My	friends laughed at me. Then there's nothing to eat. In the morning they give me bread, there is porridge for dinner and in the evening only bread again. The master and the mistress eat all the good things themselves. I sleep in the corridor and when the baby cries, I don't get any sleep at all because I've to rock the cradle. Dear Grandfather, please take me away from here, take me to the village, it's more than I can bear.' Vanka	rubbed	his	eyes	with	his	fists	and	sobbed.

'I'll grind your snuff for you, he went on', I'll pray to God to  keep  you  healthy  and  if  I  ever  do  anything  wrong,  you can beat me as you like. If you think there's no place for me then I can clean boots or even work as a shepherd boy. Grandfather, it's more than I can bear. I thought of running away to the village, but I don't have any boots. If you'll help me now, I'll feed you when I grow up and when you die I'll pray for your soul just like I do for my mother.

'Dear Grandfather, when they put up the Christmas tree at the big house, please take down a golden walnut for me and hide it in the green box. Ask the young mistress Olga, and say it is for Vanka.'

Vanka sighed and gazed in the direction of the window. He remembered it was grandfather who always went to the forest to cut down a Christmas tree for the rich people, taking Vanka with him. They had a wonderful time together, the snow falling, the trees crackling and hares springing across the trees,

When the tree had been chopped down, grandfather would drag it to the big house and they would start decorating it. The young mistress Olga, Vanka's favourite, was the busiest of  all.  Vanka's  mother,  when  alive,  had  worked  as  Olga's maid. Then Olga had given him all the sweets and played a lot with Vanka. But after his mother's death, Vanka was sent to the kitchen to be with his grandfather and from there to Alyakhin, the shoemaker.

'Come to me, dear grandfather,' Vanka wrote on, 'Please, take me away from here, have pity on me, a poor orphan. They are always beating me. I'm terribly hungry and so miserable that  I'm  always  crying.  Remember  me  to  all  my  friends.  I remain  your  grandson,  Ivan  Zhukov.  Dear  grandfather, please come soon.'

Vanka  folded  the  sheet  of  paper  and  then  put  it  in  an envelope he had bought the previous day. He thought for a while, then wrote the address: To Grandfather in the Village. He added the words: Konstantin Makarich. He was happy that no one had disturbed him while he was writing his letter. He ran out to the street to post it. Vanka had been told by the clerks that letter were dropped in boxes from where they were carried all over the world on mail coaches drawn by horse and driven by drunken drivers, while the bells jingled. Vanka ran to the nearest mailbox and put his letter in it.

An hour later, lulled by sweetest hopes, he was fast asleep. He dreamed of a stove. His grandfather was sitting beside it, reading out his letter to the cooks. Eel, the dog, was walking round the stove, wagging his tail.

1.  Enact the play in the class. Keep in mind- dialogue deliverytone, voice modulation; non-verbal communications- facial expressions,  gestures,  movements,  etc.  Many  things  are communicated through these non-verbal tools.
2.  A  communicative  task  is  given  below.  Practice  in  pairs  or groups.

## Task I

(Discussing, giving opinions, agreeing, and disagreeing)

## Role Play

Smita : Well!  What  do  you  think  about  violence  on television?

Words and ExprEssions 2 - Class x

Romila  :

If  you  ask  me,  there  is  too  much  violence  on television. Children should not be exposed to it.

Smita

:   I don't agree with you. Why do you say so?

Romila	 :

It's	not	wise	to	expose	children	to	a	lot	of	fighting, shooting, stabbing, and killing.

Smita :

But	children	find	it	thrilling.

Romila  :

No,  they  don't.  On  the  contrary  it  brutalises them  and  makes  them  insensitive.  They  look upon  violence  and  killing  as  common  place incidents.

Smita :

But  the  young  people  now-a-days  are  quite violent.

Romila :

Precisely. It is the influence of television. Wouldn't  it  be  better  if  through  television  we give  them  the  message  of  peace  and  togetherness.
