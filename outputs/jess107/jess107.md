We use different materials and services in our daily life.  Some of these are available in our immediate  surroundings,  while other requirements are met by bringing things from other places. Goods and services do not move from supply locales to demand locales on their own. The movement of these goods and services from their supply locations to demand locations necessitates the need for transport. Some people are engaged in facilitating these movements. These are known to be traders who make the products  come  to  the  consumers  by transportation. Thus, the pace of development of a country depends upon the production of goods and services as well as their movement over space. Therefore, efficient means of transport are prerequisites for fast development.

the help of equally developed communication system. Therefore, transport, communication and trade are complementary to each other.

Today, India is well-linked with the rest of the world despite its vast size, diversity and linguistic  and  socio-cultural  plurality. Railways, airways, waterways, newspapers, radio, television, cinema and internet, etc. have been  contributing  to  its  socio-economic progress in many ways. The trades from local to international levels have added to the vitality of its economy. It has enriched our life and added substantially to growing amenities and facilities for the comforts of life.

Movement of these goods and services can be over three important domains of our earth i.e. land, water and air. Based on these, transport can also be classified into land, water and air transport.

In this chapter, you will see how modern means of transport and communication serve as  lifelines  of  our  nation  and  its  modern economy. It is thus, evident that a dense and efficient network of transport and communication is a prerequisite for  local, national and global trade of today.

For a long time, trade and transport were restricted  to  a  limited  space.  With  the development in science and technology, the area  of  influence  of  trade  and  transport expanded far and wide. Today, the world has been converted into a large village with the help of  efficient  and  fast  moving  transport. Transport has been able to achieve this with

## Roadways

India has second largest road networks in the world, aggregating to about 62.16 lakh km (2020-21). In India, roadways have preceded railways. They still have an edge over railways in view of the ease with which they can be built

and maintained. The growing importance of road  transport  vis-à-vis  rail  transport  is rooted  in  the  following  reasons;  (a) construction  cost  of  roads  is  much  lower than  that  of  railway  lines,  (b)  roads  can traverse comparatively more dissected and undulating  topography,  (c)  roads  can negotiate higher gradients of slopes and as such can traverse mountains such as the Himalayas, (d) road transport is economical in  transportation  of  few  persons  and relatively  smaller  amount  of  goods  over short distances, (e) it also provides doorto-door service, thus the cost of loading and  unloading  is  much  lower,  (f)  road transport is also used as a feeder to other modes of transport such as they provide a link  between  railway  stations,  air  and sea ports.

In  India,  roads  are  classified  in  the following  six  classes  according  to  their capacity. Look at the map of the National Highways and find out about the significant role played by these roads.

- Golden Quadrilateral Super Highways: The  government  has  launched  a  major road development project linking DelhiKolkata-Chennai-Mumbai and Delhi by six-lane  Super  Highways.  The  NorthSouth corridors linking Srinagar (Jammu &amp; Kashmir) and Kanniyakumari (Tamil Nadu), and East-West Corridor connecting Silchar (Assam) and Porbander (Gujarat)  are  part  of  this  project.  The major objective of these Super Highways is  to  reduce  the  time  and  distance between the mega cities of India. These highway projects are being implemented by  the  National  Highway  Authority  of India  (NHAI).
- National Highways: National Highways link extreme parts of the country. These are the primary road systems. A number of major National Highways run in NorthSouth and East-West directions.
- State Highways: Roads linking a state capital with different district headquarters are known as State Highways.

Collect  information  of  National  Highway numbers (old and new) from the website morth.nic.in/national-highway-details. The historical  Sher-Shah  Suri  Marg  between Delhi  and  Amritsar  is  known  by  which National Highway ?

- District Roads: These roads connect the district headquarters with other places of the district.
- Other Roads: Rural roads, which link rural areas and villages with towns, are classified under this category. These roads received special impetus under the Pradhan Mantri Grameen Sadak Yojana . Under this scheme special provisions are made so that every village in the country is linked to a major town  in  the  country  by  an  all  season motorable road.
- Border Roads: Apart from these, Border Roads Organisation a Government of India undertaking  constructs  and  maintains roads  in  the  bordering  areas  of  the country. This organisation was established in 1960 for the development of the roads of strategic importance in the northern and north-eastern border areas. These roads have  improved  accessibility  in  areas  of difficult  terrain  and  have  helped in the economic development of these area.

The World's longest Highway tunnel-Atal Tunnel (9.02 Km) has been built by Border Road Organisation. This tunnel connects Manali to Lahul-Spiti valley throughout the year. Earlier the valley was cut off for about 6 months each year owing to heavy snowfall. The  tunnel  is  buit  with  ultra-modern specifications  in  the  Pir  Panjal  range  of Himalayas at an altitude of 3000 metres from the Mean Sea Level (MSL).

Roads can also be classified on the basis of the type of material used for their construction such  as  metalled  and  unmetalled  roads. Metalled  roads  may  be  made  of  cement, concrete or even bitumen of coal, therefore, these are all weather roads. Unmetalled roads go out of use in the rainy season.

## Railways

Railways  are  the  principal  mode  of transportation for freight and passengers in India. Railways also make it possible for people to conduct multifarious activities like  business,  sightseeing,  pilgrimage along  with  transportation  of  goods  over longer distances. Apart from an important means of transport the  Indian  Railways have been a great integrating force for more than 150 years. Railways in India bind the economic  life  of  the  country  as  well  as accelerate the development of the industry and agriculture.

The Indian Railways is  the  largest  public sector undertaking in the country. The first train steamed off from Mumbai to Thane in 1853, covering a distance of 34 km.

The Indian Railway is now reorganised into 17 zones.

Find out the current Railway zones and their headquarters. Also locate the headquarters of Railway zones on the map of India.

The distribution  pattern  of  the  Railway network  in  the  country  has  been  largely influenced by physiographic, economic and administrative factors.   The  northern  plains  with their vast level land, high population density and rich  agricultural  resources  provided  the  most favourable condition for their growth.  However, a large number of rivers requiring construction of bridges across their wide beds posed some obstacles.  In the hilly terrains of the peninsular region, railway tracts are laid through low hills, gaps or tunnels. The Himalayan mountainous regions too  are  unfavourable  for  the  construction of  railway  lines  due  to  high  relief,  sparse population and lack of economic opportunities. Likewise, it was difficult to lay railway lines on the sandy plain of western Rajasthan, swamps of Gujarat, forested tracks of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Jharkhand.  The contiguous stretch of Sahyadri could be crossed

Table  7.1:  India:  Railway  Track

The Indian Railway network runs on multiple gauge operations extending over 67,956 km.

| Gauge in metres                | Route (Km)   |
|--------------------------------|--------------|
| Broad Gauge (1.676)            | 63950        |
| Metre Gauge (1.000)            | 2,402        |
| Narrow Gauge (0.762 and 0.610) | 1,604        |
| Total                          | 67,956       |

only through gaps or passes (Ghats). In recent times, the development of the Konkan railway along the  west  coast  has  facilitated  the  movement of  passengers and goods in this most important economic region of India. It has also faced a number of problem such as sinking of track in some stretches and landslides.

Today, the railways have become more important in our national economy than all other means of transport put together. However, rail transport suffers from certain problems as well. Many passengers travel without tickets. Thefts and damaging of railway property has not yet stopped completely.  People stop the trains, pull the chain unnecessarily and this causes heavy damage to the railway. Think over it, how we can help our railway in running as per the scheduled time?

## Pipelines

Pipeline transport network is a new arrival on the transportation map of India.  In the past, these were used to transport water to cities and industries. Now, these are used for transporting crude oil, petroleum products and natural gas from oil and natural gas fields to refineries, fertilizer factories and big thermal power plants. Solids  can  also  be  transported  through  a pipeline when converted into slurry. The far inland  locations  of  refineries  like  Barauni, Mathura, Panipat and gas based fertilizer plants could be thought of only because of pipelines. Initial  cost  of  laying  pipelines  is  high  but subsequent running costs are minimal.  It rules out trans-shipment losses or delays.

There  are  three  important  networks  of pipeline transportation in the country.

- From oil field in upper Assam to Kanpur (Uttar Pradesh), via Guwahati, Barauni and Prayagraj. It has branches from Barauni to Haldia,  via  Rajbandh,  Rajbandh  to Maurigram and Guwahati to Siliguri.
- From Salaya in Gujarat to Jalandhar in Punjab, via Viramgam, Mathura, Delhi and Sonipat. It has branches to connect Koyali (near  Vadodara,  Gujarat)  Chakshu  and other places.
- The first  1,700  km  long  Hazira-VijaipurJagdishpur  (HVJ)  cross  country  gas pipeline, linked Mumbai High and Bassein gas fields with various ferilizer, power and industrial  complexes  in  western  and northern India. Overall, India's gas pipeline infrastructure has expanded from 1,700 km to 18,500 km of cross-country pipelines.

## Waterways

Since the ancient period, India was one of the seafaring countries.  Its seamen sailed far and near,  thus,  carrying  and  spreading  Indian commerce and culture. Waterways are the cheapest means of transport. They are most suitable for carrying heavy and bulky goods. It is a fuel-efficient and environment friendly mode of  transport.  India  has  inland  navigation waterways of 14,500 km in length. In order to create wide waterways network and to promote inland water transport in the country as an economical environment friendly supplementary mode of transport to rail and road, 111  inland  waterways    (including  5 National  Waterways  declared  earlier)  were declared as National Waterways (NWs) by the National Waterways Act, 2016. ( Source: Annual Report,  Ministry  of  Ports,  Shipping  &amp; Waterways, Government of India, 2022-23 ).

- Specified stretches of river Brahmani along with Matai river , delta  channels of Mahanadi and Brahmani rivers and East Coast Canal (588 km) - N.W . No.5

There are some other inland water ways on which substantial transportation takes place.  These  are  Mandavi,  Zuari  and Cumberjua,  Sunderbans,  Barak  and backwaters of Kerala.

Apart from these, India's trade with foreign countries is carried from the ports located along the coast. 95 per cent of the country's trade volume (68 per cent in terms of value) is moved by sea.

## Major  Sea  Ports

With a long coastline of 7,516.6 km, India is dotted with 12 major and 200 notified nonmajors (minor/intermediate)  ports.  These major ports handle 95 per cent of India's foreign trade.

Deendayal Port (Kandla) in Kuchchh was the  first  port  developed  soon  after Independence to ease the volume of trade on the  Mumbai  port,  in  the  wake  of  loss  of Karachi port to Pakistan after the Partition.

Deendayal Port, is a tidal port. It caters to the convenient handling of exports and imports of highly productive granary and industrial belt  stretching  across  UT  of  Jammu  and Kashmir, and the states of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat.

Mumbai  is  the  biggest  port  with  a spacious natural and well-sheltered harbour. The Jawaharlal Nehru port was planned with a  view  to  decongest  the  Mumbai  port  and serve as a hub port for this region. Mormugao port (Goa) is the premier iron ore exporting port of the country . This port accounts for about fifty per cent of India' s iron ore export. New Mangalore port, located in Karnataka caters to the export of iron ore concentrates from  Kudremukh  mines.  Cochin  is  the extreme south-western port, located at the entrance of a lagoon with a natural harbour.

our neighbouring countries like Sri Lanka, Maldives, etc. and the coastal regions of India. Chennai is one of the oldest artificial ports of the country . It is ranked next to Mumbai in terms  of  the  volume  of  trade  and  cargo. Vishakhapatnam is the deepest landlocked and  well-protected  port.  This  port  was, originally , conceived as an outlet for iron ore exports.  Paradwip  port  located  in  Odisha, specialises in the export of iron ore. Shyama Prasad  Mookerjee,  Kolkata  is  an  inland riverine port. This port serves a very large and rich hinterland of Ganga- Brahmaputra basin. Being a tidal port, it requires constant dredging of Hoogly . Haldia port was developed as  a  subsidiary  port,  in  order  to  relieve growing pressure on the Kolkata port.

great ease. Think of the north-eastern part of the country , marked with the presence of big rivers,  dissected  relief,  dense  forests  and frequent floods and international frontiers, etc. in the absence of air transport. Air travel has made access easier.

Pawanhans Helicopters  Ltd.  provides helicopter  services  to  Oil  and  Natural  Gas Corporation in its  off-shore  operations,  to inaccessible areas and difficult terrains like the north-eastern states and the interior parts of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) is a firstof-its kind scheme globally, designed to jump-start the regional aviation market. Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN was conceived by the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), Government of India, to promote regional connectivity by making fly affordable for the common citizen. The central idea of the scheme is to encourage airlines to operate flights on regional and remote routes through enabling policies and extending incentives.

## Communication

Ever since humans appeared on the earth, they  have  used  different  means  of communication. But, the pace of change, has been rapid in modern times. Long distance communication is far easier without physical movement of the communicator or receiver. Personal communication and  mass communication including television, radio, press,  films,  etc.  are  the  major  means  of communication in the country . The Indian postal network is the largest in the world. It handles parcels as well as personal written communications. Cards and envelopes are considered first-class mail and are airlifted between stations covering both land and air. The second-class mail includes book packets, registered newspapers and periodicals. They are carried by surface mail, covering land and water transport. To facilitate quick delivery of mails in large towns and cities, six mail channels have been introduced recently . They are called Rajdhani Channel, Metro Channel, Green Channel, Business Channel, Bulk Mail Channel and Periodical Channel.

India  has  one  of  the  largest  telecom networks in Asia. Excluding urban places more than two-thirds of the villages in India have already been covered with Subscriber Trunk Dialling (STD) telephone facility. In order to strengthen the flow of information from the grassroot to the higher level, the government has made special provision to extend twentyfour hours STD facility to every village in the country.  There  is  a  uniform  rate  of  STD facilities all over India. It has been  made  possible  by  integrating  the development  in  space  technology  with communication technology.

Mass communication provides entertainment and creates awareness among people about various national programmes and policies.  It  includes  radio,  television, newspapers, magazines, books and films. All India Radio (Akashwani) broadcasts a variety of programmes in national, regional and local languages for various categories of  people, spread over different  parts  of  the  country.

of  India,  is  one  of  the  largest  terrestrial networks in the world. It broadcasts a variety of programmes  from entertainment, educational to sports, etc. for people of different age groups.

India  publishes  a  large  number  of newspapers and periodicals annually. They are of different types depending upon their periodicity.  Newspapers  are  published  in about 100 languages and dialects. Did you know that the largest number of newspapers published in the country are in Hindi, followed by  English  and  Urdu?  India  is  the  largest producer  of  feature  films  in  the  world.  It produces short films; video feature films and video short films. The Central Board of Film Certification is the authority to certify both Indian and foreign films.

## International Trade

The exchange of goods among people, states and countries is  referred  to  as  trade.  The market is the place where such exchanges take place. Trade between two countries is called international trade. It may take place through sea, air or land routes. While local trade is carried in cities, towns and villages, state level trade is carried between two or more states. Advancement of international trade of a  country  is  an  index  to  its  economic prosperity.  It  is,  therefore,  considered  the economic barometer for a country.

As  the  resources  are  space  bound,  no country  can  survive  without  international trade. Export and import are the components of trade. The balance of trade of a country is the difference between its export and import. When the value of export exceeds the value of imports, it is called a favourable balance of  trade.  On  the  contrary,  if  the  value  of imports exceeds the value of exports, it  is termed as unfavourable balance of trade.

India has trade relations with all the major trading blocks and all geographical regions of the world. The commodities exported from India  to  other  countries  include  gems  and jewellery,  chemicals  and  related  products, agriculture and allied products, etc.

# PAGE 11

The  commodities  imported  to  India include  petroleum  crude  and  products, gems and jewellery, chemicals and related products,  base  metals,  electronic  items, machinery, agriculture and allied products. India has emerged as a software giant at the international  level  and  it  is  earning  large foreign  exchange  through  the  export  of information technology.

## Tourism as a Trade

Tourism in India has grown remarkably over the  past  two  decades,  with  government initiatives,  infrastructure  development,  and global branding contributing to this success. To  boost  tourism  in  India,  schemes  like Swadesh  Darshan  2.0,  Vibrant  Village Programme, PRASHAD (Pilgrimage Rejuvenation  and  Spiritual  Heritage Augmentation Drive), Paryatan Mitra, etc. have been started. Tourism also promotes national integration,  provides  support  to  local handicrafts and cultural pursuits. It also helps in  the  development  of  international understanding about our culture and heritage. Foreign tourists visit India for heritage tourism, eco  tourism,  adventure  tourism,  cultural tourism,  medical  tourism  and  business tourism.

There is a vast potential for development of tourism in all parts of the country. Efforts are being made to promote different types of tourism for this upcoming industry.

On the map of India show important tourist places of your State/UT and its connectivity with other parts of the country by railways/ roadways/airways.

Discuss in the class:

- What type of tourism may be developed in your state/UT and why?
- Which areas in your state/UT you find more attractive for development of tourism and why?
- How tourism may be helpful for the economic development of a region adopting sustainable development approach?

Prepare a project on the heritage tourism in India.
