You already know that three-fourth of the earth's surface is covered with water, but only a  small  proportion  of  it  accounts  for freshwater  that  can  be  put  to  use.  This freshwater is mainly obtained from surface run off and ground water that is continually being  renewed  and  recharged  through  the hydrological cycle. All water moves within the hydrological  cycle  ensuring  that  water  is  a renewable resource.

You might wonder that if three-fourth of the world is covered with water and water is a  renewable  resource,  then  how  is  it  that countries and regions around the globe suffer from water scarcity? Why is it predicted that by 2025, nearly two billion people will live in absolute water scarcity?

WATER SCARCITY AND THE NEED FOR WATER CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT

Given  the  abundance  and  renewability  of water, it is difficult to imagine that we may suffer from water scarcity. The moment we speak of  water  shortages,  we  immediately associate it with regions having low rainfall or  those  that  are  drought  prone.  We instantaneously  visualise  the  deserts  of Rajasthan  and  women  balancing  many ' matkas '  (earthen  pots)  used  for  collecting and  storing  water  and  travelling  long distances to get water. True, the availability of water resources varies over space and time, mainly due to the variations in seasonal and annual precipitation, but water scarcity in

most cases is caused by over-exploitation, excessive use and unequal access to water among different social groups.

Where is  then  water  scarcity  likely  to occur? As you have read in the hydrological cycle,  freshwater can be obtained directly from  precipitation,  surface  run  off  and groundwater.

Is it possible that an area or region may have ample water resources but is still facing water scarcity? Many of our cities are such examples. Thus, water scarcity may be an outcome of large and growing population and

consequent greater demands for water, and unequal  access  to  it.  A  large  population requires  more  water  not  only  for  domestic use but also to produce more food. Hence, to facilitate higher food-grain production, water resources are being over-exploited to expand irrigated  areas  for  dry-season  agriculture. Irrigated agriculture is the largest consumer of water. Now it is needed to revolutionise the agriculture  through  developing  drought resistant crops and dry farming techniques. You  may  have  seen  in  many  television advertisements that most farmers have their

own wells and tube-wells in their farms for irrigation to increase their produce. But have you ever wondered what this could result in? That it may lead to falling groundwater levels, adversely affecting water availability and food security of the people.

Post-independent India  witnessed intensive industrialisation and urbanisation, creating vast opportunities for us. Today, large industrial houses are as commonplace as the industrial units of many MNCs (Multinational Corporations). The ever-increasing number of industries has made matters worse by exerting pressure  on  existing  freshwater  resources. Industries, apart from being heavy users of water, also require power to run them. Much of this energy comes from hydroelectric power. Moreover,  multiplying  urban  centres  with large  and  dense  populations  and  urban lifestyles have not only added to water and energy  requirements  but  have  further aggravated the problem. If you look into the housing societies or colonies in the cities, you would find that most of these have their own groundwater pumping devices to meet their water needs. Not surprisingly, we find that fragile  water  resources  are  being  overexploited and have caused their depletion in several of these cities.

Atal  Bhujal  Yojana  (Atal  Jal)  is  being implemented in 8220 water stressed Gram Panchayats of 229 administrative blocks/ talukas in 80 districts of seven states, viz. Gujarat,  Haryana,  Karnataka,  Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. The selected States account for about 37 per cent of the total number of water- stressed (over-exploited, critical and semi-critical) blocks in India. One of the key aspects of Atal Jal is to bring in behavioural changes in the community, from the prevailing attitude of consumption to conservation and smart water management.

So far we have focused on the quantitative aspects of water scarcity. Now, let us consider another situation where water is sufficiently available to meet the needs of the people, but, the area still suffers from water scarcity. This scarcity may be due to bad quality of water. Lately, there has been a growing concern that even if there is ample water to meet the needs of the people, much of it may be polluted by domestic and industrial wastes, chemicals, pesticides and fertilisers used in agriculture, thus, making it hazardous for human use. Government of India has accorded highest priority  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  and enhance ease of living of people especially those living  in  rual  areas  by  announcing  the  Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM). The Goal of JJM is to enable  every  rural  household  get  assured supply of potable piped water at a service level of  55  litres  per  capita  per  day  regularly  on long-term basis by ensuring functionality of the tap water connections.

You may have already realised that the need of the hour is to conserve and manage our water resources, to safeguard ourselves from health  hazards,  to  ensure  food  security, continuation of our livelihoods and productive activities and also to prevent degradation of our natural  ecosystems.  Over  exploitation  and mismanagement of  water  resources  will impoverish this resource and cause ecological crisis  that  may  have  profound  impact  on our lives.

But, how do we conserve and manage water? Archaeological  and  historical  records  show that  from  ancient  times  we  have  been constructing sophisticated  hydraulic structures like  dams built  of  stone  rubble, reservoirs or lakes, embankments and canals for  irrigation.  Not  surprisingly,  we  have continued this tradition in modern India by building dams in most of our river basins.

What are dams and how do they help us in  conserving  and  managing  water?  Dams were traditionally built to impound rivers and rainwater that could be used later to irrigate agricultural fields. Today, dams are built not just for irrigation but for electricity generation, water  supply  for  domestic  and  industrial uses,  flood  control,  recreation,  inland navigation and fish breeding. Hence, dams are now referred  to  as  multi-purpose  projects where the many uses of the impounded water are integrated with one another. For example, in the Sutluj-Beas river basin, the Bhakra Nangal project water is being used both for hydel  power  production  and  irrigation. Similarly,  the  Hirakud  project  in  the Mahanadi basin integrates conservation of water with flood control.

A dam is a barrier across flowing water that obstructs, directs or retards the flow, often creating a reservoir, lake or impoundment. 'Dam' refers to the reservoir rather than the structure. Most dams have a section called a spillway or weir over which or through which it  is  intended  that  water  will  flow  either intermittently  or  continuously.  Dams  are classified according to structure, intended purpose or height. Based on structure and the materials used, dams are classified as timber dams, embankment dams or masonry dams, with several subtypes. According to the height, dams can be categorised as large dams and major dams or alternatively as low dams, medium height dams and high dams.

In  recent  years,  multi-purpose  projects and  large  dams  have  come  under  great scrutiny  and  opposition  for  a  variety  of reasons. Regulating and damming of rivers affect their natural flow causing poor sediment flow and excessive sedimentation at the bottom of the reservoir, resulting in rockier stream beds and poorer habitats for the rivers' aquatic life.  Dams  also  fragment  rivers  making  it difficult for aquatic fauna to migrate, especially for spawning. The reservoirs that are created on the floodplains also submerge the existing vegetation and soil leading to its decomposition over a period of time.

Sardar Sarovar Dam has been built over the Narmada River in Gujarat. This is one of the largest water resource projects of India covering four states-Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan. The Sardar Sarovar project would meet the requirement of water in drought-prone and desert areas. Sardar Sarovar Project will provide irrigation facilities to 18.45 lakh hectare of land, covering 3112 villages in 15 districts of Gujarat. It will also irrigate 2,46,000 hectare of land in the strategic desert districts of Barmer and Jalore in Rajasthan and 37,500 hectare in the tribal hilly  tract  of  Maharashtra  through  lift. About 75 per cent of the command area in Gujarat  is  drought  prone  while  entire command in Rajasthan is drought prone. Assured water supply will soon make this area drought proof.

Ironically, the dams that were constructed to control floods have triggered floods due to sedimentation in the reservoir. Moreover, the big dams have mostly been unsuccessful in controlling  floods  at  the  time  of  excessive rainfall.

Collect information about floods occurred in different parts of the country due to heavy rainfall in recent times.

These floods have not only devastated life and property but also caused extensive soil erosion. Sedimentation also meant that the flood plains were deprived of silt, a natural fertiliser, further  adding  on  to  the  problem  of  land degradation. It was also observed that the multipurpose projects induced earthquakes, caused water-borne diseases and pests and pollution resulting from excessive use of water.

Irrigation has also changed the cropping pattern of many regions with farmers shifting to water intensive and commercial crops. This has  great  ecological  consequences  like salinisation of the soil.

Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana has been started which ensures access to some means to protective irrigation for all agricultural farms in the country, thus bringing much desired rural prosperity. Some of the broad objectives of this programme are to enhance the physical access of water on the farm and expand  cultivable  area  under  assured irrigation (har khet ko pani), improve on-farm water use efficiency to reduce wastage and increase  availability  both  in  duration  and extent,  irrigation  and  other  water  saving technologies  (per  drop  more  crop)  and introduce  sustainable  water  conservation practices, etc.

Do you know that the Krishna-Godavari dispute is due to the objections raised by Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh governments? It is regarding the diversion of more water at Koyna by the Maharashtra government for a multipurpose project. This would reduce downstream flow in their states  with  adverse  consequences  for agriculture and industry.

## R RAINWATER  H HARVESTING

Many thought that given the disadvantages and  rising  resistance  against  the  multipurpose projects, water harvesting system was  a  viable  alternative,  both  socioeconomically  and  environmentally.  In ancient India, along with the sophisticated hydraulic  structures,  there  existed  an extraordinary tradition of water-harvesting system. People had in-depth knowledge of rainfall regimes and soil types and developed wide  ranging  techniques  to  harvest rainwater, groundwater, river water and flood water in keeping with the local ecological conditions and their water needs. In hill and mountainous regions, people built diversion channels  like  the  'guls'  or  'kuls'  of  the Western Himalayas for agriculture. 'Rooftop rainwater  harvesting'  was  commonly practised to store drinking water, particularly in Rajasthan. In the flood plains of  Bengal,  people  developed  inundation channels to irrigate their fields. In arid and semi-arid regions, agricultural fields were converted into rain fed storage structures that allowed the water to stand and moisten the soil like the 'khadins' in Jaisalmer and 'Johads' in other parts of Rajasthan.

In  the  semi-arid  and  arid  regions  of Rajasthan, particularly in Bikaner, Phalodi and  Barmer,  almost  all  the  houses traditionally  had  underground  tanks  or tankas for storing drinking water. The tanks could  be  as  large  as  a  big  room;  one household in Phalodi had a tank that was 6.1 metres deep, 4.27 metres long and 2.44 metres wide. The tankas were part of the welldeveloped  rooftop  rainwater  harvesting

system and were built inside the main house or the courtyard. They were connected to the sloping roofs of the houses through a pipe. Rain  falling  on  the  rooftops  would  travel down  the  pipe  and  was  stored  in  these underground 'tankas'. The first spell of rain was usually not collected as this would clean the roofs and the pipes. The rainwater from the subsequent showers was then collected.

Rooftop  rainwater  harvesting  is  the most common practice in Shillong, Meghalaya. It is  interesting  because Cherapunjee and Mawsynram  situated at a distance of 55 km. from Shillong receive the highest rainfall in the world, yet the state capital Shillong faces acute shortage  of  water.  Nearly  every household in the city  has  a  rooftop rainwater harvesting structure. Nearly 15-25  per  cent  of  the  total  water requirement of the household comes from rooftop water harvesting.

Today, in western Rajasthan, sadly the practice of rooftop rainwater harvesting is on the decline as plenty of water is available due to the perennial Indira Gandhi Canal, though some houses still maintain the tankas since they  do  not  like  the  taste  of  tap  water. Fortunately, in many parts of rural and urban India, rooftop rainwater harvesting is being successfully adapted to store and conserve water.  In  Gendathur,  a  remote  backward village in Mysuru, Karnataka, villagers have installed,  in  their  household's  rooftop, rainwater  harvesting  system  to  meet  their water  needs.  Nearly  200  households  have installed this system and the village has earned the rare distinction of being rich in rainwater. See Fig. 3.6 for a better understanding of the rooftop rainwater harvesting system which is adapted here. Gendathur receives an annual precipitation of 1,000 mm, and with 80 per cent of collection efficiency and of about 10 fillings, every house can collect and use about 50,000 litres of water annually. From the 200 houses, the net amount of rainwater harvested annually amounts to 1,00,000 litres.

Rooftop harvesting was common across the towns and villages of the Thar. Rainwater that falls on the sloping roofs of houses is taken through a pipe into an underground tanka (circular holes in the ground). built in the main house or in the courtyard. The picture above shows water being taken from a neighbour's roof through a long pipe. Here the neighbour's rooftop has been used for collection of rainwater. The picture shows a hole through which rainwater flows down into an underground tanka.

## BAMBOO DRIP IRRIGATION SYSTEM

In  Meghalaya,  a  200-year-old  system  of  tapping  stream and spring  water  by  using  bamboo  pipes,  is  prevalent. About 18-20 litres of water enters the bamboo pipe system, gets  transported  over  hundreds  of  metres,  and  finally reduces to 20-80 drops per minute at the site of the plant.
